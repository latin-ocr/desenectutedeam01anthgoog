Ernesti entertains doubts respecting edixere, and reads dixero,- but
edixere is well defended by scheller and Gemhard, who make edi·
cere here to be the same as patefacere. (Compare, also, Kritz, acl
Sall„ Cat, xlviii„ 4, p. 2210—me. ‘⁶ Remark.”—Di:iuee. The
subJunctive, because the words of the person spoken os are referred
to. (Zumpt, 9 545.)—Ut si aliquando esset mm. “ As is he were
some time or other going to hate.” (Compare Aristode, Rhea, ii..
13; where, in speaking of the old, he says, καὶ φιλοῦσιν ὡς· μισήσον-
τες, κ. r. λ.)-Ηοσ. The saying just referred to is' ascribed to Bias
by Aristotle (Rhea, ii., 13), Diogenes Laertius (ἱ, 87), and others.
(Compare Menag., ad Diog. Lucre„ 1. c. )—-Impuri cujusdam, dte. ‘⁸ Of
some sordid meten, or of some ambitione individual, or of one who
refers,” dte. Laelius, or, rather, Cicero is guilty here os injustiee
toward Bias. The Grecian sage refers merely to ordinary acquaint-
ances, as appears plainly from the words of Diogenes Laertius
which come immediately aster,·namely‚ τοὺς γὰρ πλείστους κακούς,
and also from the following: συνεόοὐλευέ τε ὦδε. Βραδέως ἐγχείρει
Τθῖς· πραττομένοις· ὃ δ’ ἂν ἕλῃ, βεόαἱως τηρῶν διάμενε. Consult Bei-
er's note on the present passage—Necesse erit cupere et optare, dte.
This, again, is an unsair view of the maxim of Bias. He does not
mean that one is to wish that his friend may prove his enemy, and
thus afford him an opportunity for breaking off, but that a man must
be on his guard in the ease of ordinary acquaintanees, lest such a*
state of things may occur.

Ut ne quando inciperemus. ‘⁴ That we should never begin.” Ob-
serve that quando is for aliquanda—Potius quam inimicitiarum, dte.
“Rather than that we should think of any period of enmities,” i. e,
should think that any period could arrive when friendship would be
eonverted into eumity.— Ut cum emendati, dre. “ That when the
characters of friends are irreproachable.” More literally, ‘⁴ are free
from any defect or stain.'' This, in fact, forms the first step, name-
ly‚ that we form connectione of friendship¹ with men of irreproach· '
able characters— Ut etiam, si qua fortuna acciderit, dcc. ‘⁴ So that,
even if it have happened by any chance that,’' &e.—Declinandum sit
de via. Graevius cites, as instanees of the application of this rule,
the defence of Milo by (licere, and that of Norbanus by Antonius
the orator. (Cia, De Orat„ ii.,· 48, 49.)—Modo ne summa turpitudo
sequatur. ‘⁸ Provided only the highest degree of turpitude do not
follow,” i. e, be not thereby incurred. This is rather loosely worded,
and might seem to justify the suspicion that Cicero thought the
