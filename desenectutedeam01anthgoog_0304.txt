” round aud rode up to the scene of dispute, when he was wounded
in the shoulder by one os the gladiatore. The frey now became
general. The party of Clodius were put to ssight, and betook them-
sfflves, with their leader, to a house near Bovillae. Milo ordered
his men to attack the house. Several os Clodius’s meu were elain.
and he himself dragged out and dispatched. The body was left
lying on the road, till a senator, named Sextus Tedius, found it,
and conveyed it to Rome. Here it was exposed to the view os the
populace, who crowded to see it. Next day it was carried naked to
the forum, and again exposed to view before the rostra. Tbe mob,
enraged by the spectacle‚ and by the inflammatory speeches of the
tribunes Munatius Plancus and Q. Pompeius Rufus, headed by Sex-
tus Clodius, carried the coi-pse into the Curia Hostilia, made a su·
neral pile of the benches, tables, and withige, and burned the body
on the spot. Not only the senate-house, but the Porciau Basilica,
erected by Cato the Censor, and other adjoining buildings, were re-
duced to ashes.

Clodius was twice married, first to Pinaria and nsterward to Ful-
via. He left a son, Publius, and a daughter. He inherited no
property from his father. Resides what he obtained by less honest
means, he received some moneys by legacies, and by letting one of
his houses on the Palatino. He also received a considerable dowry
with his wife Fulvia. He was the owner ’of two bouses on the
Palatine Hill, an estate near Alba, and considerable possessione in
Etruria, near Lake Prelius. His persona! appearance was effemi-
nate, and neither handsome nor commanding. That he was a man
of great energy and abuity there can be little questionu still less
that his character was of the most profligate kind. Cicero himself
admits that he possessed considerable eloquence.

The chief ancient sources for the lise os Clodius are the speeehes
of Cicero 'pro Gaelio, pro Sextio, pro Milone, pro Domo sua, De Harus-
picum Responde, in Pisonem, and in Clodium et Curionem, and his
Letters to Atticus and his brother Quintus; Plutarch's Lives of
Lucullus, Pompey, Cicero, and Casan and Dio Cassius. Of mod-
ern writers, Middletom iuliis Life os Cicero, has touched upon the
leading points os Clodius’s history; but the best and fullest account
has been given in Drumann’s Geso-hicme Ronu, vol. ii., p. leo-370. ”
