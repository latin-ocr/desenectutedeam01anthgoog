iards than his avaricious general, Lucidius, was able to acquire.

(App-ian, vi„ 54.) The year following, 150 B.c.‚ Scipio was sent
by Lucullus to Africa, to request Masinissa to send a number of
elephante over to Spain. He was most honorably received. Mss-
inissa and the Cartbaginians were just preparing for battle3 Scipio
beheld the contest from an eminence; and as soon as the Cartha·
ginians were apprised os his presence, they entreated him to 'act as
mediator between them and Masinissa. But he was not able to 012·
*fect what they wished, and he returned to Spain with the elephante.
(Appiam, viii„ 71, ἀει).
When the war between Carthago and Rome broke ont, Scipio,
then still mssitary tribune, went to Africa, and here, again, distin-
guished himself so much by his courage, prudence, and justice, that
he not only gained the unlimited confidence os his own countrymen
and Masinissa, but even os the Carthaginians, who trusted no Ro·
man but Scipio. Roman ambassadors, who were sent ιο the camp
in Africa to report on the state of affairs, on their return to Rome
were unbounded in their praise of Scipio and os the attachment of
-the soldiers to him. (Appiam, viii, 98, dcc.) In 148 B.C., when
the consul Calpnriiffis Piso undenook the command in Africa,
Scipio returned to Rome, where every body appears to have been
convinced that he alone was able to complete the conquest of Car-
thage. Cato said that Scipio alone was alive, while all the other
‘generals were mere shadows. (Lim, Epic„ 493 Polyb„ xxxvi„ 6.)
The consul Piso made very little progress in Africa, and, when
scipio was a candidate for the oedileship, he was unanimously elect·
ed consul for the year 147 B.c., though he had not yet attained the
legitimate age: he obtained Africa for his province. On his return
to Africa he was accompanied by Polybius and Laelius5 and imme-
diately after his arrival he saved a ‘considerable body of Roman
soldiers, who had penetrated into one of the suburbe of Carthago.
(Appiam viii„ 113, dcc.) He restored discipline in the Roman army.
His first operation was to cut off all supplies, which the Carthagin-
ians had hitherto received from the interior of Ari-ica, and in the
following winter (147-146 Rc.) he succeeded in taking Nepheris,
whence the Carthaginians, till then, had received their supplies by

sea. His command of the army was prolonged sor the year 146
Rc„ and in the spring of this year he made his attack upon the

city, which was defended with the utmost despair, and by a de'cree
of the senate he razed it to the ground. He is said ιο have wept
over its ruins, and to have uttered the prophetie words of Homer,
as applicable to his own native city (IL, vi., 448, seqq:
