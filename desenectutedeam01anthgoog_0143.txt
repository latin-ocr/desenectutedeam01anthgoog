that the final syllable in versat is lengthened here by the arsis, so
that there is no need of reading suh for in, ss some ‹lo—Praemt,
for proemii. Some MSS. and editions have pretii, which is con-
demned by Bentley (ad Ter„ Andr.. ii., 1, 20), who maintains that
no poet before Propertius employed the double i in the genitive
’ singular. (Compare Zumpt, § 49, note 1.) · .

Ille vir, haud magna cum re, dcc. “That man, with no great
wealth indeed, yet rich in trustworthiness,” i. e„ poor in point of
worldly means, but rich in all that is worthy of reliance on the part
of his fellow-men. Commentators generally suppose that Ennius
is meant, and that Cicero here describes him by a line drawn from
one of his poems, but referring there to some other person. Dra·
kenborch, however, more correctly‚ refers' this verse to Sextus
AElius Paetus, already mentioned, and thinks that Cicero meant this
individual, not Ennius—Pteme fidei. Observe here the elision of
the final s in plenus, before a consonant, in the beginning of the next
Ι word. The earlier Latin poete were in the-habit of frequently eli-
ding the letter ε, in words ending in 'is and fta-when followed by‘a
word beginning³with a consonant; and thus permitting the vowel to
remain short—Fidei. As regards the penult in this word, consult
Anthon’s Lat. Prot„ p. 17, note.

Sollicitari te Tite, otc. Anpther quotation from Ennius, but prob·
ably only in part, the first portion of the line being, in all likelihood,
from the pen of Cicero himself. The verse in Ennius runs as fol-
lows: “ Et qua deprimeris frustra noctesque diesquefl consult, how- “
ever, Column„ ad loc„ p. 140.—Moderatiomm animi tui, dte. ‘⁸ Your
moderatiori and even temper of mind ;'’ more literally‚ “the mod-
eration of your mind, and your equanimity.” As regards the mod·
eration of Atticus, compare Nep„ Ate„ c. 14. Observe, moreover,
that aquilas is here equivalent to aquabilitas, of which Cicero him·
sels gives us the definition elsewhere (Off, i., 26, 2): “Praeclara
est oequabilitas in omni vita, idem semper υιιὶιιισ, eademque srons.” -

Cognomen Athenis deportasse. His sur-name of Atticus appears to
have been given him on account os his long residence at Athens
(twenty years), but more particularly on account of his intimate ac·
quaintance with the language and literature of Greece. (Compare
Cic„ de Fin„ v. 2 ; Nep„ Art„ c. 3, 4.)-—Humanitatem et prudentiam.
“ The philosophie calmness os a cultivated intellect, as well as a pru-
dent spirit.” Observe the peculiar force of humanatam, a term
which some explain here by ‘⁶ polite learning,” aad others by “ a
taste for literature.” The true meaning is given by Wetzel: ⁴⁶ Hw-
mam'eas, hoo loco, est animi literis exculti aquabilitas, qui nihil? admiratur
