counterbalanced hy unremitting diligence on our part.” Lange and
others give compescenda, an inferior reading, though it has been fol-
lowed by Gaza in his Greek version: κολαστέον πρὸς ἀκρὶὅειαν τὰς
αὐτοῦ κακίας.

Habenda ratio valetudinis. “ Regard must be had by us to health,”
i. e., we must he regularly attentive to the article of health. Cato
here proceeds to lay down certain dictetic rules for the preserva-
tion of health amid advancing years—Tantum. ‘⁴ Only so much.”—-
Refieiantar. ‘⁴ May be reinvigorated.”—Haec. Referring to mens
and animas. Observe here the employment of the demonstrative
in the neuter, as indicating things of different genders, and which
eonvey not a personal, but an abstract idea—Nisi tamquam lumini,
dec. ⁴⁶ Unless you, as it were, pour oil gently into the lamp.” Lit-
erally‚ “ pour oil gently in sor the light,'' i. e., to keep the light alive.
—Exercitatione ingravescunt. “ Grow weary through exercise.”
The old reading is defatigatione et exercitatione ingravescunt, the most
recent one (that of Klotz, Madvig, and others) exercitationum defati-
gatione. Both, however, appear inferior to the one which we have
given—Levantur. “ Are resteshed.” Equivalent to leviores et agi-
liores fiunt.

Nam quoe ait Goecilius, dec. ‘⁴ For asto those wh0, Caecilius says,
are the dotards represented in comedies.'’ With cenes supply eene.
The words comicos stultos senes are here quoted, with a change of
construction, from the passage of Caecilius Statius that occurs in
the De Amicitia, c. 26. The reference is to weak old men, repre-
sented on the stage to excite the laughter of the audience. The
humor os the ancient comedy frequently turned upon some old man,
who was exhibited throughout the piece as continually imposed upon
by the cunning of an artful -slave and intriguing courtesan—Hos
signifieat. ‘⁴ By these he means.’' Literally‚ “ he indicates these as
being.”—Dissolatos. ‘⁴ Careless.” (Consult Some, Lex. Cicer-ors,
ε. v.)-Libido. ‘⁴ The license of the passione.'’—Ista senilis stultitia:
As described by Caecilius. Observe that ista here denotes contempt.
(Zumpt, ᾧ 701.)—Deliratio. ⁴‘ Dotage.” The derivation of this
word is as follows : lirare is ‘⁶ to sow seed in a furrow” (lira), and, of
course, in a straight line : a deviation from this was called deliratio,
and thence the metaphorical usage of the word. In fact, this single

„— word expresses the whole of the stoic dogma, that the road to virtue

is a straight line, and every deviation from it equally criminal.
