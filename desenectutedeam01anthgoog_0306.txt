understood his tools. He gratified Pompey by external marks of
honor, and Crassus with gold. The ruling passion of Crassus was
avarice3 and, to repair and. increase the fortunes os his family, he
was williug to submit to servile dependence, to encounter any risk,
and undergo any hardship. He undertook a service oi· considerable
danger in levying troops for Sulla among the Marsi, and he aster-
ward (Rc, 83) distinguished himself in a successful campaign in
Umbria. He* was personally brave, and by fighting against the
remains of the Marian saction he was avenging the wrong· os his

house. Sulla put him in mind of this, and rewarded him by dona· '

tions of confiscated property, or by allowing him to purchase, at an
almost nominal velue, the estates of thooe that were proscribed.
, Crassus was reported to have sought for gain by dishonest means.
He was accused of unduly appropriating the booty taken at Tuder,
an Umbrian colony not far from the Tiber, and of placing, without
authority, a name in the proscribed lists, in order that he might suc-

The desire os wealth which absorbed Crassus was neither the
sels-sufficing love os possession, which enables the miser to despise
the hiss os the 'people while he contemplates the coin in his chest3
nor did it spring from that voluptuousness which made Lucullus
value the means of material enjoyment; nor from that losty ambition
which made Sulla and Caesar look upon gold as a mere instrument
of empire. Crassus sought wealth because he loved the reputation
of being rich, liked to have the power of purchasing vulgar popu-

over the debtor‚ and· over the man whq wants to borrow or hopes
to profit. To these objeets the administration of civil affairs and ·
wal-like command were, in his view, subordinate. He possessed
very great ability, and steady industry in obtaining what he desire‘d,
and soon began to justify his hereditary surname Dives. He ex-
tended his influence by acting as an advocate before the courts, by
giving advice in domestic affairs, by canvassing for votes in favor
of his friends, and by lending money. At one time of his lise there
was scarcely a senator who was not under some private obligation
to him. He was affable in his demeanor to' the common people,
taking them by the hand and addressing them by name. Rich lega-
cies and inheritances rewarded his* assiduity and complaisance to
the old and wealthy. He was a keen and sagacious speculator.
He bought multitudes of slaves, and, in order to increase their value,
had them instructed in lucrative arts, and sometimes assisted per-
