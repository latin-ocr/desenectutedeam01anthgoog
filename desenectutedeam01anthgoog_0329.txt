Cicero, following the system of Pythagorae, compares the move-
mente of the seven planete and the ephere of the fixed etars to the
vibratione of the eight chorda which compoeed the ancient musical
instrument called octachord, formed of two disjunct tetrachordS, or
of eight stringe, producing the eight tonee or sminde of modern mu-
sic, namely, mi, fa, sol, la, ei, ut, re, mi,· eo that the moon, the low-

' eet of the planete, anewere to mi, the graveet of the eight sounde ;

 

Mei-cury, to sa3 Venus, to col,- the Sun, to Ia,- Mare, to εἰς Jupiter,
to ut,- Satura, to τις and the ephere of the fixed stare, which is the
most elevated os all, to mi, the ahai-pest mund, and making the oc-
tave with the gravest. These eight scande, ae may be seen, are
separated hy eight intel-vals, according to certain proportions; eo
that from mi to fa ie the distance os a semitone·; from mi to sol,
that of a minor third3 from mi to la, that of a quarter tone3 from
mi to ci. that of a fisth3 from mi to ut, that of a minor εἰκὼς and
from mi to re, that of a minor aeventh; which, with the octavo,
form in all seven accorde. (Bm-ecte, ad loc.) ⁶

In quibus eadem eze vis duorum. ιφ In which two have the· same
force.” The reference ie to the two stare at either extremity, cor·
responding in their movements to the vibratione of the two extreme
stringe os the tetrachorda, that ie, the two mi. (Bur-ecte, ad loc.)
Some editione read after duorum the words Mercurii et Veneris ,- but
these are a mere gloss, and interfere with the sense—Distinctos in-
tervallie. ‘⁸ Separated by regular intervale.”-Qui numnis rerum
mnium, &c St. Jerome makes en allusion to thie passage in hie
forty-eighth letter, where he says: “An sonitem Pythagoram, ee Ar·

Compare, mox-cover, ae regards the idea expressed in the text, the
language of Quintilian (i., 10, 12): “Atque claros nomine capientia

que eum secuti, acceptam eine dubio antiquitus opinionem vulgaverint,
