duties of his office, and followed P. Scipio Africanus to Sicily, and
from that island to Africa—Consul in Hispania. Cato obtained
the consulship in B.C. 195, when thirty-nine years old, and obtained
Hither Spain for his province. In his Spanish campaign he exhib-
ited military genius of a very high order. - Tribunus militaris.
Cicero is supposed by many to have made a slight mistake here,
since, according to Livy (xxxvi, 17), cato was on this occasion a
consular legatus, and since, as they affirm, no one was ever made
tribune of the soldiers aster having filled the office of consul. To
this last assertion, however, a direct contradiction has been given,
founded on several passages os Livy (xlii, 49; xliv„ ις xxii„ 49),
and one os Plutarch (Vit. Flamin„ e. 20); so that the point may be
regarded as by no means a settled one, and Cicero, after all, may be
right.

Apud Thermopylas. The reference is to the battle fought with
Antiochus the Great. This monarch‚ alarmed at Glabrio‘s progress

The very same year in which this discourse is supposed to have
been delivered, Cato prevailed upon the senate, notwithstanding
the opposition os Scipio Nasica, to determine upon the destruction
of Carthage.—Non rostra. After his censorship‚ the public life of
Cato was spent chiefly in sorensic contests, senatorial debateS, and
speeches to* the people. In the very last year os his lise he took a
conspicuous part in the righteous‚ but unsuccesssul, prosecution os
S. Sulpicius Galba, sor his flagrant breach of saith toward the Lusi-
tani. Cato made a powerful speech on this occasion against Galba,
and inserted it in the seventh book of his Origines, a few days or
months before his death. (Cia, Brutus, '23.)— Clientes. Consult

Mature fieri senem, dne. ‘⁸ To become an old man soon, if you
wish to be an old man long.” The true meaning os the proverb is
that, if we wish to lead a long lise, we should acquire and practice
in our youth those virtues which are more generally obser-ved in
old men, namely, moderatim, temper-auce, dcc„ and, viewed in this
light, the maxim is an excellent one. Cato, however, chooses to
understand the proverb ina very different sense, as meaning that
