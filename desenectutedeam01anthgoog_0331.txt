were in the same parallel, but opposite meridians3 by ‹im-ouem,
those under the same meridiati, but opposite ραι-811013, and by ἀντ-ι’-
ποόες, those who were in opposite paranels and meridianis, i. e.,
diametrieally opposite—Quasi quibusdam, dcc. The term quasi is
again employed to excuse the use of terms not usual with Cicer-0,
namely, redimitam sud cingulis. The reference is to the zones —-
E quib-us duos, duc. Al'luding to the two frigid zones. Both of these
were regarded by the ancients as uninhabitable. (Compare Horat„
i„ 22, 17, und Vir-g„ Geor-g„ i., mim—Diverso& The adjective di-
versus is osten used by Cicero, as here, in the sense of oppositus or
contrarius. Compare Or. de Leg- Agr„ ii„ 32, 87: “ Corinthus.. .
duo maria, maxime navigationi diversa„ .oooejungehac.” So, alac,

lues ’-··.⁸⁰¹¹'⁸' ardore ωπον-ι’. The ancients believed the torrid zone
to be also uninhabitsble —Adversa vobis urgent vestigia. “Plant
sootsteps directly opposito to you,” i. ο., are your antipodes.

Vos contingat. ‘⁴ It has to do with you.”-Tant0 nomine. “ Al-
though of so great a name.'’—Gaucasum hunc ..... illum Gange-m.
‘⁴ Caucasus here ..... the Ganges yonder.” Observe the force of
the pronouns here, and their employment δεικτικῶς. -- obeuntis.
Some read abeuntiu- but compare Cic„ De Dio„ i., 56: “qui .....
siderum ortus, obitus, motusque cognorunt? ’and also Cic, Arai„ 467:

“Abditur Orion, obit et Lepus abditus umbra! ’-Quibu.s amputatis.

“Is these now be lopped off.”

Propter eluviones, &a This is in acco‘fflance with the stote ‹roo-
trine, that the world is liable to destruction from the pre-valence of
moisture, or of dryness3 the former producing a universal inunda-
tion‚ the latter a universal conflagration. These succeed each other
as regularly as winter and summer. (Compare Philo, de Mund. in-
corr„ p. 94ος Εηειό., Proep. En„ iv„ p. 816; Polyb„ vi„ 5, 5.)—-Qui
ante nati sunt. A much more correct reading* than nati sint of the
’common text. - Qui nec pauciores et certe, dcc. Compare Zumpt,

is subsequently stated, or the period during which the sun, moon,
and planets return to the point in the heavens where their‘revolu-
