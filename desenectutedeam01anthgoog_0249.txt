o Fines, ct quui termini. ‘⁸ Boundariea, and, as it were, limits.”—
Ferri. ⁸‘ Are promulgated.”—Pariter oequditerque. ‘⁸ In degree
and value.” More literally, “ in quantity and quality.”— Ue, quanti
quisque u ipse facit, dte. “ That each one be estimated by his
friends only as highly as he estimates himself.” The explanation
os this may be gathered from 9 59.--·Nec enim illa prima, dcc. This
nec ought to be followed by another; but, in consequence os the
length of the intervening clause quam mlta enim ..... fruantur, a.
change of construction is brought in at ο 58.-- Ut quemadmodum in
‘ee quisque, dte. The apparent contradiction between what is here
stated and what we find in Tusa. Πίσῃ, iii„ 29, 6 73. is well ex-
plained by Gernhard.-Quam multa enim, dcc. Imitated from Xeno-
phon, Mem.. ii., 4, 7, πολλάκις ἃ πρὸ αὑτοῦ τις οὐκ ἐξειργάσατο, κ. τ.
λ. Compare the remark of Madame Lamhert, aa quoted by Le
Clerc: ⁴011 y a bien des choses qu'im honneur delicat vous de'smdrait

pour vous meme, qu’il vous serait permis et Ῐιοπηὲεε de faire pour voc “

amie.’'-Prccari ab indigno. Wetzel thinks that this may have some
latent reference to Cicero’s oration sor Marcellus before Caesar.—
Acerbiuae. ⁴⁶ With more than ordinary acrimony.”—Homee. ‘⁶ Be-
comingly.”

ς) 58.

Quoe definit amicitiam, dcc. ‘⁸ Which determines the measure of
friendship by an equal amount of kind offices and affection,'’ i. e.,
which determines the measure of our affection and kind offices by
exactly proportioning them to the value and quality we receive of
each.—Hoc quidem est nimis exigue, dte. “ This, indeed, is to sub-
ject friendship, in too small and narrow a spirit, to mere calculation‚
in order that the account of debits and credits may be made to'
balance‚'’ i. e., that the debit and credit sides of the account may
balance. -Ne quid excidat, dcc. Compare the remark of Balzac:
.“ Comme il y a des rivibres qui ne sont jamaiae tant de bien que quand
elles se de'bordent3 de mesme, l'amitie‘ n’a rien de meillmr que l’eaecesff’

ο 59.

’ Tertius ille finis. ‘⁶ The third limitation (of friendship).”-Animus

its.”—-Si prius edixero. ·‘ Aster 1 shall have first made known.”
