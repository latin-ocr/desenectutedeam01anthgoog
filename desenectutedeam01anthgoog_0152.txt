Artes, exercitationesque virtutum. ‘⁴ The liberal arte, and the prac-
tice of virtue.” Compare the version of Franklin: ‘⁴ A life employ-
ο edin the pursuit of useful knowledge, in bonorable actions, nnd the
practice of virtue.” By artes are here meant artes inge-nm or liber·
ales, embracing‚ os course, literary pursuits of every kind. The
arma sementia, mentioned in the text, are the means afforded us
sor wardIng off the discomforts of age—In omni oetate. ⁴⁴ At every
period of life,'' i. e., in the previous seasons of lise.--Efferunt. A
much better reading than afferunt, as given by Facciolati and others.
(Consult Ernesti, Glav. cic„ and ad Off, i., 15, 5.)—-Quamquam ia
maximum est. ‘⁶ Although thie os itself is a very important consid·
eration.’' Equivalent to id quod eane, &c (Compare Zumpt, «5 341.)

—Benefactorum “ Good deeds.”

Q. Maximum. This is the famous Q. Fabius Maximus, sumamed
ἵ . Cunctator, the celebrated opponent os Hannibal—Tarentum recepit.
He recovered Tarentum from the Carthaginians in his fisth consul-

ἕ bility.” More literally, ‘⁴ seasoned with.”-Eum colere. ⁴⁴ To cul-

tivate bis acquaintance.”

Anno enim post, &e Observe the tmesis, as it is called, in poet·
quam. Fabius was consul for the first time in Ro. 233. Liguria
was his province, and it afforded him a triumph, and an opportunity

eo quartum consule, dac. Fabius obtained his fourth consulship in
Bo. 214, when Cato was twenty years of age. Hence the latter
calls himself here adolescentulus, “a very young ¹man.”—Ad Capuam.
Fabius had commenced the siege of this place the year previous
(Rc. 215), when consul for the third time—Quaestor deinde quadri,
ennio post sactus eum, dcc. The common text reads as follows:
