Sermonis delectationem. ‘⁸ The delights οἰ social converse.’'—
Tempestivis quoque conviviis delector. ‘⁴ Take great plcasure, alst),
in prolonged banquets.'’ By tempestiva convivia are meant banquets
which commence before, and are prolonged aster the usual time;
and they generally have connected with them the idea of revelry
and carousing. No such idea, however, is intended here, hut the

chosen, by both the Greeks and Romans, to regulare the whole order
os the entertaininent, propose the amusements, fix the times for
calling sor the wine, or, as we would say, give out the toasts, ἁο.
The Greeks called him συμποσίαρχος, οι· βασιλεύς, the Romans ma-
gister, or rex convivii, or arbiter bibendi. The choice was generally
determined by a throw os astragali or tali. (Βία. Aac„ a. υ. Sym-
