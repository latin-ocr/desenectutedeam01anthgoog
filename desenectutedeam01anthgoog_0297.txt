28⁰ excussus 1.

Toward the close os BD. 62, clodius was guilty of an act os sae-
rilege which is especially memorable, as it gave rise to that deadly
⁰ animosity between him and Cicero, which produced such important
consequences to both and to Rome. The mysteries of the Bona
Dea were this year celebrated in the house of Coesar. Clodius, who
had an intrigue with Pompeia, Cissar's wife, entered the house,
with the assistance os one os the attendants, disguised as a female
musician. But while his guide was gone to appi-ize her mistress,
Clodius was detected by his voice. The alarm was immediately
given, but he made his escape by the aid os the damsel who had
introduced him. He was already a candidate for the quaestorship,
and was elected3 but in the beginning of B.O. 61, before he set out ’
sor his province, he was impeached sor this offence. The senate
referred the matter to the pontifices, who deelared it an aet of im-
piety. Under the direction of the senate a rogation was proposed
ιο the people, to the effect that Clodius should be tried by judiees,
selected by the pretor, who was to preside. The assembly, how-
ever, was broken up without coming to a decision. The senate
was at first disposed to persist in its original plan; but aster-ward,
on the recommendation os Hortensius, the proposition os the tribune
Fufius Calenus was adopted, in accordanee with which the judices
were to be selected from the three decuries. Cicero, who had hith-
erto strenuously supported the senate, now relaxed in his exertions.
Clodius attempted to prove an alibi, but Cicero’s evidence showed
that he was with him in Rome only three hours before he pretended
ιο have been at Interamna. Bribery and intimidation, however,

secui-ed him an aequittal, by a majority of thirty-one to twenty-five. x 1

Cicero, however, who had been irritated by some sareastic allusions
made by Clodius to his consulship, and by a verdiet given in eon-
tradiction to his testimony, attached Clodius and his partisans in
the senate with great vehemence.

Soon aster his aequittal‚ Clodius went to his province, Sicily, and
intimated his design os beeoming a candidate sor the aedileship. On
his return, however, he disclosed a different purpose. Eager to re·
venge himself on Cicero, that he might be armed with more sormi·
dable power, he purposed becoming a tribune of the plebs. For this
it was necessary that he should be adopted into a plebeian family;
and as he was not in the power of his parent, the adoption had to
take place by a vote of the people in the Comitia Curiata. Repeat-
ed attempta were made by the tribune 0. Herennius to get this
brought about. Cicero, who placed reliance on the friendship and
support of Pompey, did not spate Clodius, though he at times shows
