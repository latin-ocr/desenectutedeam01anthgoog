ειη-θ’ Indeed, the context evidently requires such an explanation3
and it is in full accordance, moreover, with the language οἱ· Nepos,
in his lise of Atticus (c. 17), where he says of him, “Principum plai-
losophomm ica percepta habuit precepta, ut hie ad vitam agendam, non
ad ostentationem uteretur.” As regards the “prudentia’' of Atticus,
consult Nepos, Ate„ c. 6, seqq.

Eisdem rebus. He allodes to the gloomy state of public affairs.—
Quibm me ipsum. ‘⁸ By which Ι confess that I myself am.” Sup-
ply suspicor before me ipsum, in the sense ofsateor, and observe the
zeugma that takes place in the vero—Ee mjor est. ‘⁸ Is both a

whom to inscribe such a work, a work to which we might both of
us have recourse with equal advantage. With occurrebas supply
animo or menti.— Ut non modo absterserit. ‘⁴ That it has not only
wiped away,” i. e., completely removed. A metaphor from the
wiping away of tears, blood, dre—Mollem et jucundam. ‘⁴ An *easy
burden and pleasing to endure.'’

Satis dig-ne. ‘⁴ Sufficiently in accordance with its true worth.'’
The term digne here has been deemed spurious by some editors, and
a mere marginal explanation of eatis, which eventually crept into
the text. Not so, however, by any means. We have rendered it
in accordance with the explanation os Klotz, ‘⁴ nach ihrem wahren
