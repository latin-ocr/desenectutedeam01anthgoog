Μ. TULLII CICERONIS SOMNIUM SCIPIONIS. ⁴⁶ M. Tullius
Cicero’s Dream of Scipiost The account of this dream, or vision,
ie put into the mouth of the younger Scipio Africanus, who relate·
that, in early youth, when he first eerved in Africa, he visited the
court os Masinissa, the eteady friend os the Romans, and particu-
larly of the cornelian family. During the feaste and entertainments
of the day, the conversation turned on the ,words and actione of the
first great Scipio. His adopted grandson having retired to rest, the
Shade of the departed hero appeared to him in' sleep, darkly fore-
told the tuturo events of hie life, and encouraged him to troad in ’

the pathe os patriotism and true glory, by announcing the reward ,

prepared in a future etate for those who have served their country
faithfully in this life. The circumstances of time and place selected
sor thia dream, as well as the characters introduced, have been
most felicitously chosen; and Cicero has nowhere more happily
united a high reach of thought to brilliant imagination. '

Macrobius, to whom we are indebted for the preservation of the
Smnium Scipionis, has given a curione astronomical, or, rather, a·-
trological commentary on the influence os numbers in forming the
crisie os Scipio's lise. His tract was greatly admired and exten-
sively etudied during the Middle Ages‚ and contains a successioni
os discourees on the physical'conatitution of the universe, according
to the views of the New Pletoniam, together with notices of some
os their peculiar tenete on mind aa well as matter.

The Smnium Scipionis originally formed part os Cicero’s work
De Republica, being contained in the aixth book. It has been pub-
liehed by Mai in his edition os the recovered De Republica, and also
in the edition of Greuzer and Moser, Frankfi, 1826, svo. The au-
thenticity of the pieee has been attacked by Kunhardt, in Seehode's ¹
Kritieche Bibliotkek fiir dtu Schul— und Unterrichtewesem 1820 (p.
4⁷4-482; 658—5653 649-6532 1000-1007), and ably defended by

Moser.
