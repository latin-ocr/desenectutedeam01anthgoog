EXGURSUS 11. ·

LIFE ΛΝΒ ΟΗΑΒΑΟΤΕΒ, OF >CRASSUSJ

M. Licinius Crassus Dino was the younger son of P. Licinius
cra-sus Dives, who was consul Rc. 97. The date of his birth is
not precisely recorded, but it is probable that he was born about the
year Ro, 115, for Plutarch states that he was younger than Pom-
pey (Vie. Crass„ 6), and that he was more than sixty years old when
he departed (in the year Rc, 55) to make war against the Par-
thians. (Ia, 17.) “

In the year Rc. 87, when his father and brother suffered death
for their resistance ιο Marius and Cinna, he was not considered os
sufficient importance to be involved in the same doom; but he was
closely watched, and, after some time, he thought it prudent ιο
make his escape to Spain, which he had visited some years before,
when his father had the command in that country. How he con·
cealed himself in a cavern near the sea, upon the estate os Vibius
Paciaecus, and how he passed his days in this strange retreat, is
related in detail by the lively and amusing pen of Plutarch. After
a retirement of eight months, the death of Cinna (13.0. 84) relieved
him from his voluntary confinement. He put himself at the head
os a needy rabble, for whose sustenance he provided by maranding
excursions, and, with twenty-five hundred men, made his way to
Malaca. Thence, seizing the vessels in the port, he set sail for
Africa, where he met Q. Metellus Pius, who had escaped from the
party of ⁴ Marius. He soon quarreled with Metellus, and did not re—
main long in Αἰτίοις for when Sulla (B.C. 83) landed in Italy,
Crassus proceeded to join that victorious general.

He was now brought into competition with Pompey‚ who also
served under Sulla.. The mind of Crassus was os an essentially
vulgar type. He was noted for cury, but his envy was low and
caviling; it was not energetic enough to be cruel and revengeful,
even when successful ς audit was so sar under the control os pusil-
lanimity and sels-interest, as to abstain from the open opposition of
manly hatred. It was with such feelings that Crassus regarded
Pompam and Sulla played off the rivale against each other. He
