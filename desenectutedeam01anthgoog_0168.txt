Sassine territory, at a· distance from his native town. 1t was here
that he passed the earlier and many of the later years of his life,
and hence the reference in the text to his country neighbors. (Com-

on, unless they themselves were present and took part in the same.

“Perciperesructum ex olea.”)-In aliie. “In the case of other things,”
i. e., in the case os those things which appertain unte, and intimately
concern them. Observe thatin aliis here stands opposed to in eie,
quoe sciunt nihil ad se omnino pertinere. consult Klotz, ad loa, who
correetly condemns the explanation of Orelli. Some read in illis,
‘⁸ scil. negotiis, quorum fractus annum σις’ as Ernesti explains it,
but this is decidedly inferior. Madvig also gives in aliis, and in tho
Greek version os Gaza we have ἐπὶ τῶν ‹zazoa—Nihil mnino ad :C
pertinere. Compare the explanation of Billerbeck ε “ nullum utilitatis
fructum semet ipsos inde esse capturos.”

Sei-it arbom, dec. This line is commonly read and arranged aa
follows: Ser-ic arbores quoe alteri seculo prosim, and if we adopt this
as the correct form os the verse, it can not, of course, be scanned as
an iambic trimeter, even according to the cornio scale, without vio-
lating the metre, and we must come to the unavoidable conclusion
that Cicero quotes here from Statius, without regarding any metri·
cal arrangement os the words, and consequently that this quotation
ought to be printed merely as so much prose; just as Moser has
given it in his edition of the Tusculan Disputations (i., 14), where it
also occurs. As this, however, might look like an avoiding of the
difficulty, we have preferred adopting the reading οἰ· Grotefend (cited
by Emer-beck), and which has been followed also by Spengel.
(ki-agni. Stat„ p. 50.) We have thus a good comio iambic trimeter:

Hermann, however (Leipz. Lim, 1819, p. 171), prefers regarding the
line as a Cretic tetrameter, and his opinion is adopted by Nobbe
and Billerbeck, as well as by a critic in the Heidelb. Jahrb. d. Lite„
1826, p. 984. Hermann’s arrangement is as follows :

Serit
ᾶνόὄνὲε, Ι quoe eiltb'ri Ι εᾶσίὶὶὂ 1 prodent!

Ut ait Statius noster, &e ‘⁴ As our Statius says in ‘The Youth·
ful comrades.' ” This was a Greek comedy of Menander’s, which
Statius has translated into Latin. Its Greek title was Συνεφηόοἱ.
