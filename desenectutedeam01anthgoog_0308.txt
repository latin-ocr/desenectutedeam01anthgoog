trust of the optimates, while Cesar endeavored to increase the
estrangement by promoting a union between Pompey and Crassus
in popular mensures. With their united support the lex Aurelia
was carried, by which the judices were selected from the populus
(represented by the tribuni erarii) and equites as well as the sen-
ate, whereas the senate-had possessed the judicis exclusit-ely dur-
ing the preceding twelve years, by the lex Comelia of Sulla. The
jealousy os Crassus, however, prevented any cordiality of senti-
ment, or general unity of action. He saw himself overborne by the
superior authority os his colleague. To gain favor, he entertained
the populace at a banquet of ten thousand tables, and distributed
eorn enough to supply the family of every citizen sor three months3
but all this was insufficient to outweigh the superior personal con·
“ sideration of Pompey. The coolness between the consuls became
a matter ofpublic observat-ion, and, on the last day os the year, the
&night Ο. Aurelius (probably at the instigation of cesar) mounted
the tribune, and announced to the assembled multitude that Jupiter,
who had appeared to him in a dream the night before, invited the
consuls to be reconciled before they lest office. Pompey remained
cold and· inflexible‚ but Crassus took ‘the first step by offering his
hand to his rival, in the midst os general acclamations. The recon-
ciliation, however, was hollow, for the jealousy of Crassus contin-

Manilian IaW, whieh conferi-ed the command against Mithradates
upon Pompey, rankled in the mind os Crassus. When Pompey re·
turned victorious, Crassus, from timidity or disgust‚ retired for a
time from Rome.

In the year Ro, 65, Crassus was censor with Q. Catulus, the
firm supporter of the sen-ate; but the censore, in consequence of
their political discordance, passed the period of their office without
holding a census or a muster of the equites. In the following year
Crassus failed in his wish to obtain the rich province of E'gypt.

Crassus was suspected by some, probably without sufficient rea-
son, of being privy to the first conspiracy of Catilin03 and again, in
the year B.C. 63, L. Tarquinius, when he was arrested on his way
to Catiline‚ affirmed that he was sent by Crassus, with a message
inviting Catiline to come with speed to the rescue of his friends at
Rome ; but the senate denounced the testimony of Tarquinius as a
calumny, and Crassus himself attributed the charge to the suborna-
tion of Cieero. (Sala, Β. G„ 48.) The interests of Crassus were
opposed to the success, ofthe eunapii-acm for it would have required
