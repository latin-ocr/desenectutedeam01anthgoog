the soul had an existence prior to her connection with the body
seems to have been an opinion of the highest antiquity, as it may be
traced in the Chaldaean, Egyptian, and Grecian theology, as sar

Pythagorae, aster traveling in many countries, fixed his residence
among the Italian Greeks, in Magna Graecia, and particularly at
Crotona. Hence Cato styles him and his followers “incolas poene
nostros? from their inhabiting a part of the same peninsula with the
Romans, and more particularly from their bearing the name of the
Italic school.-·-Qui essent Italici, dcc. “ Since they were formerly
denominated the Italic philosophers.” Observe the employment of

Italici. Not Itali, which latter would only have been employed thus
by the poete—Ea: universa mente divina delibatos. ‘⁶ Called from
the universal soul divine.‘’ Pythagoras maintained that the human
soul was an emanation from the great soul os the universe, a doc·
trine adopted by many other philosophare, and very probably of emly
Oriental origin.
