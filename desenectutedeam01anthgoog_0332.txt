'rna sommum sermon-rs. 315

‘dis in eundem recurrentibus locunt, quod fit post XII. millia nongenta
quinquaginta quatuor annos.” So, alec, Cic„ Ν. D., ix„ 20: “Qua-
· rum ex disparibus unctionibus magnum armum mathematici nominave-
runt, qui tum efficitur, cum solie et lunoe et quinque errantium ad ean·
dem inter se comparationem consectis omnium spatiis est sacta conver·
defi-Eandem coeli descriptionem. ‘⁶ The same aspect of the heav-
ens.” ,

Namque, ut olim deficere, dcc. He here gives an idea of a mag-
nus annus, beginning with the eclipse of the sun at the death of Rom-
ulus, and to end when the sun shall again be eclipsed in the same
qum-ter of the heavens and at the same instant—Quandoque. For
quandocunque—Ad idem principium. ‘⁸ To the same point of be-
ginning.”—Nondum vigesimam partem, dec. From the death of Rom·
ulus to the period of the present dream, five hundred and severity-
three years had elapsed, according ‘to the Roman computatiom
which would, of course, not be as yet the twentieth part of a stagnus
annus, whether we· take the number of years composing one to be}
according to Cicero, in his Hortensius, as above cited, twelve thou-
sand nine hundred and fisty-four years, or, according to Macrobius
(ad Somn„ ii„ 11), fifteen thousand years. .

Si reditum in hunc locum desperaveris. ‘⁸ If thou despair-est of a
speedy return to this quarter.” This refers to the Younger Scipio’s
exclamation in chapter iii. z ‘⁶ Quid moror in terris? quin hue ad vos
venire propero? There is no necessity whatever, therefore, of our
reading speraveris with some editors—In quo omnia sunt. ‘⁸ In
which all things are prepared.” Equivalent to in qao munia sune
parata. (Ramnes, ad lacy—Neque te dederis. “And shalt not hav'e
allowed thysels to be influeneed by.”--Spem posueris renam tuarum.
‘⁸ Shalt make the great object of thy achievements to consist.’'—Ad
verum decus. ‘⁸ To true glory.”—Quid de te alii loquantur, ᾱο. 'rho ³
idea intended to be conveyed is this: Leave to others the care of
ascertaining what they are to say of γους for they will make you·
a subject os conversation, beyond all doubt—Sermo autem omnis ille,
dte. Tho reference is to mere human hine.

,CHAPTER vm.

Si quidem bene meritis, dec. ’ “ If, indeed, for those who have de·
servent well of their country, a path, as it were, lies open for access
to the skies.'’ Compare, as regards the term limes here, Dict. Ana,
s. ν. Agrimensores.-Patriis. Referring to AEmilius Paulum—Non

esse te mortalem, dte. Compare Cic„ Rue„ i., 22: ‘⁴ Neque noe eor- · ’
