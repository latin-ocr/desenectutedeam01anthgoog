appetite for which pleasure.” Compare Pacciolati: u Avida libidi-
m .· ita appellantur vehementiores appetitus et cupiditates.”—Ad

Glandestina colloquia. “ Clandestine conferences‚'' i. e.. secret

ἵ correspondence with intent to betray one’s country.-Nullum nuatum
i facinus. ‘⁶ No evil deed.” Observe that facinus (fromfaeio) means

any act or proceeding from which important consequences solloW,

J whether it be good or bad. Hence the addition bere of the epithet
, mum, to give a more definite meaning to the noum-Impeuerec.
ἶ The subjunctive again, like incitarentur in ὁ tia—Nisi voluptatis.

b

rightly called mam, because it is a free-will gist, or, in other words,
u favor. (Compare Crombie, Gymnasium, vol. i., p. 115.)

prlaced aster this verb, or aster animo, it would have given rise to
ambiguity‚ on account of the nearness of jubebat, which might have
seemed to govern it.—Quanta percipo] ponec maxima. ⁴⁴ As great
a one as could possibly be conceived.” Supply mente aster percipi,
and observe the peculiar construction of the superlative (mxima)
with quanta, where the latter supplies the place os quam. consult
