-2, The person addressed in the preface, or introduction, must be
Pomponius Atticus, the fiiend of Cicero. This is fully proved by a
passage in the life of Cato (snb fin), where we read, ‘⁴ Hujus de vita
et moribus plura in ιο libro persecuti sum quem separatim de eo seci-
mu rogatu Pomponii Attici,” which is unquestionably porrectly de-

cisive in so sar as the memoir in which they occur is concerned;
but this, ⁴as we heve seen, was not included in the original edition,
is wanting in some MSS„ end, along with the Atticus, is separated,
as it were, from the rest in all.
, 3. The losty tone in which the grandem· end power os the Roman
people are celebrated, the boldness of the cominente on free insti-
tutione and tyrants, would have been totally >out of place at sn epoch
of degradation end slavery. Allusionffi also, it is essii-med, may be. .
detected-to the civil war between Coesar and Pompey. Upon a cere-
sul examinatior: of all the quotations adduced, it will be seen that
no weight ought to be attached to this portion of the proof.

4. Lambinus was informed, upon what he considered good au.
thority, that one MS. ended in this manner: ‘⁶ emplemm ascopa·
AEmizis· Probi, emetis· Nepotis.” But, even if we admit the aecu-
rscy of a statement vouched for so imperfectly, it leads to no result,
‚for the first clause might be intended to assign the twenty biogra-
phies, the De Regibus, the Hamilcar, and the Hannibal, to Probus;
the concluding phrase to mark Nepos as the author of the Cato and
the Atticus. ,

The question thus started has given rise to interminable discus-
sione ; but the leading hypotheses may be reduced to three:

1. Many of the contemporaries of Lambinus, unable or unwilling
to abendon the belief in which‘they had been reered, and clinging
to the verses addressed to Theodosius, dogge'dly maintained that
the old opinion was, aster all, true3 and that all the lives, except,
perhaps, those of Cato and Atticus, which stood upon somewhat
different ground, were the property of Probus, and of no one else.
This position· is now very generally abandoned.

2. hawinus, as we heve seen, pronounced the lives to belong
entirely to Cornelius Nepos. These who support this hypothesis,
which has been 'more widely received than any other, hold that
what we now possess may be regarded either as a portion of the
voluminous collection, De Viris Illustribue, or as an independent
work, which, having fallen into oblivion, was brought to light by
AEmilius Probus, who fraudulently endeavored to palm it off as his
own, or, perhaps, meant to do nothing more than claim the credit
of having discovered and described it ; or, that the verses in ques-
