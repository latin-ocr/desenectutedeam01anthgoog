was a disciple os Socrates. He does not appear, however, to have

profited much by his master‘s instructions, is we may trust the test·

“ imony os AEschines the Socratic (ap. Athen„ v., 22⁰, A), by whom
he is represented as destitute os refinement, and sordid in his mode
of living. -

Cyrum minorem, dcc. ‘⁶ That Cyrus the Younger, the Persian
prince.'’ With minorem supply natu. He was called the younger,
to distinguish him from the elder Cyrus, or Cyrus the Greia, the
founder of the Persian empire. Cyrus the Younger was the son of
Darius Nothus, and attempted-to dethrone his brother Artaxerxes,
but lost his life in the attempt. He was merely satrap over some
os the western provinces of Asia Minor, and therefore the term re·
gem in the text is to be regarded as having merely the force os reg-
ulum. (Compare Freund, ε. v.)-Imperii gloria. ‘⁴ In the glory os
his swayss* i. ι.. his sway as satrap or viceroy, os which Xenophon
draws so flattering a picture. (Anah, i., {iq-Lysander. The cele-
brated Spartan commender in the Peloponnesian war. The date
os the narrative given in the text was ΒΟ. 407, when Lysander
was sent out to sueceed Cratesippidas in the command of the fleet,
the Spartans, as it would appear, having been induced to appoint
him, partly because his ability marked him as fit to eope with Al·-
cibiades, and partly that they might have the advantage os his pe·
culiar talents os supple diplomacy at the court os Cyrus the Younger.
-Vir summa virtutis. The reference here is to ability or merit,
not to moral virtue, in which last the character of Lysander was
particularly deficient. Compare Gom. Nep„ Vit. lays„ i., 1 ε “ Ly-

, eander Lacedoemom‘m magnam reliquit wisantum, mag-is felicitate quam
virtute partam.” ¹

Sardis. Accusative plural, for Sardes. Sardis, the ancient cap·
ital of ijdia, at the foot os the northern slope of Mount Tmolus, and
on the River Pactolus, was the residence, at this tinie, of Cyrus,
as satrap—Sociis. , The Peloponnesians, and other states which
had confederated against the Atheniens—Communem. ‘⁴ Affable.”
(Compare the Greek κοινός.) The ordinary text has comem, a much
inferior reading, though retained by Ernesti. Xenophon, in his re-
lation of the affair, has ἄλλα τε φιλοφρονεῖσθαι Cicero, however,
throughout his whole version os the story, renders Xenophon’s Greek
very freely, according to his usual eustom, adding some things,
omitting others, and retrenehing others.— Quendam conseptum
agrum. Xenophon ealle this τὸν· ἐν Σάρδεσι παράδεισον, “ the park
at Sardis.”
