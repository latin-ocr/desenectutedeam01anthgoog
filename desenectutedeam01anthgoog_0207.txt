Cum in optimo filio meo. Μ. Porcius Cato Licinianus is meant,
the son of the censor by his first wife Licinia, and of whom we have
already'spoken. After serving in the army, he appears to have de-
voted himself to the practice os the law, in which he attained to

dignitatem. ‘⁶ Who were expected to attain to the highest prefer·
ment‚” i. e., who had by their merite given rise to the expectation
that they would attain one day to the highest honors of the state. ’
The individuals alluded to were the two younger sons of L. AEmil-
ius PauluS, and half brothers of the younger Africanus. One of
th'em, twelve years os aga-died only five days before his father's
triumph over Perseus, king os Macedonia, and the other, fourteen
years os age, three days only aster the triumph. The losswas all
the severer‚ since AEmilii'is had no other sons left to carry his name
down to posterity.—Quod idem. ‘⁴ Which same thing.”—Eo meliora
conditione. ‘⁸ So much the better off.” '
