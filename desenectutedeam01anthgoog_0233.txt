-Ue quidam docti. An allusion to the Stoica, and their imaginary
standard of virtue—Qui habentur. ‘⁴ Who are regarded as such in
the general opinion of mankind.”—Pauloe‚ eatam, dcc. ‘⁴ The Pauli,
Catos,” dte„ i. a, such men as AEmilius Paulus, Cato, Gallus, the
Scipios‚ Philus. We have already made frequent mention osAEmil-
ins Paulus, the conqueror of Macedonia, and of the elder-Cato. By
Gallus is meant C. Sulpicius Gallus, with regard to whom consult
De Samot.. chap. xiv„ ᾧ 49. By the Scipios he means the brothers
Publius and Cnoeus Scipio (compare De Seneca, chap. xx„ ς) 75),
and the elder Africanus. Philus has been already mentioned in

xxi.) We have preferred, however, following the authority os Orelli,
