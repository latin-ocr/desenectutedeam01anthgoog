CHAPTER XV.

a> 52.

Deliciis deffluentes. ‘⁸ Melting away in sensual delighta.” The
reflerenee is 'to mere eelfish sensualiets. Observe the peculiar
soree of deliciis deffluere, as applied to the dissolving of our mental
and phyaieal energies in the lap of luxurious indulgence—Nec usu
nze ratione. -“Neither by experienoe nor reflection.”- Ut neque

diligat quemquam, dte. “Without loving any one, or being himself ·

beloved by any one.” Observe here the force of ut with the nega-
tive, and compare Zumpt, § 539. The more litei-al version will be,
‘⁶ so that he neither love,'’ dte„ ι’. e., on condition that he neither
love—Fides. ‘⁴ Confidenoe.”—Nulla stabilis benevolentioe fiducia.
⁴⁸ No firm foundation for lasting good-will.”

ι) 53, 54.

Celantur tamen simulatione, &e “ They are cour-ted, however, it
is true, with a semblence (os personal attachment), but only sor a
time.”—— Tum emendantem. “That then, when in exile.'’ Some ·
commentatore consider tum here as superfluous, and reject it, ae-
cordingly, from the text. Consum, however, Beier, ad loc.--111a su-
perbia et importunitate, dte. ‘⁸ If, with that hanghty and overhearing
temper of his, he could ever have had any one friendly to him.”-
Hujus. Tamum—Multorum opes proepotentium. “The power of
many very influential men,'' i. e.‚ the being advanced to power and
elevated stations.—Effemntur. “They are carried away.”-Im2·-
piente fortunato. ‘⁴ Thau a foolish favorite os fortune.”—-Conmodi3
moribus. ‘⁴ Of obliging manners.”

copiis, facultatibus, opibus. “By their abundant resourceS, their
wealth, their power in the state.”—Supellectilem. ⁸⁴ Garniture.’'-
Ejus est enim istorum quidque, διο. “For each of those things be-
comes the property of him who surpasses them in strength,” i. e.,
for whoever shall invade them with a stronger arm, to him these
will infallibly belong—Inculta et deserta ab amicis. ‘⁴ Uncultivated,
and lying desert, as far as friends are concerned.’' On this pecul-
iar soree of the preposition ab, consult Zumpt, 9 305.
