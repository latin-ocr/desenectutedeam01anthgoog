that at first he was known b'y the additional cognomen Priscus, but
was aiter-ward called Cato, a name denoting that practical wisdom
(catus, ‘⁴ wisess’j‘ shrewd”) which is the result of natural sagacity,
combined with experience of civil and politica! affairs. The quali-
ties implied in the word Cato were subsequently acknowledged by
the plainer and less archaic title of Sapiens, by which he was so
well known in his old age that Cicero here, and also in the treatiee
⁸⁴ De Amicitia” (c. 2), makes it his quasi cognomen. (Smitla, Dice.
Biogr„ s. v.)

Naturam optimam ducem. The. Stoice, as already remarked, re-

ferred all things to nature, and their grand rule was in all things to
live according to her lawe. For a virtuous life, according to them,
was merely a lise agreeable to our experience of what is going on
in nature, since the human is a part of the universal nature. (Diog.
Lacr-t„ vii„ 87.)—C'um σείεται partes (etatis, dre. “After the other
parts in life have been wisely distributed,” i. e„ after all the pre-
ceding periods os life have had their peculiar and proper enjoy-
ments assigned to them. The true reading here is discripta: sim,
as denoting'distribution. The common reading is ἀπονέμω sint,
but describere is ‘⁴ to write down‚” ‘⁴ to copy.” Observa, moreover,
that partes is here employed in its dramatic sense, as indicating a
part or character to be maamad—Extremum actum. ‘⁸ The last
aet of all‚'' i. e., old age.-Inerti. “Unskillsul.” The adjective
iners is here employed in its primitive meaning, the word being
compounded of in privative and ars. Compare Lucil.·, ap. Serv. ad
AE'n„ it, 1582 ‘⁶ Ut perhibetur inere, ars in quo non erit ulla.”
· Euo aliquod extremum, διο. “ That there should be something to
mark the close of existence, and, asin the case of the fruita of treee
and the productione os the earth, something, from the fullness os its
own maturity, drooping, as it were, and just ready to fall, which
must he endured by the wise man with calm resignation.” There
must be no comma aster. maturitate. tempestiva, since these words
belong to what follow‘s, the maturity meant being that of old age,
whose fruit is withered and drooping. The term victu-2 is well ex·
plained by Wetzel: ‘⁴ Vietum, languidum, aim vi, naturalibus viribus
privatum, μεμαρασμένον, a vetere glossatore aplicatum.”—Gigantum
modo. ‘⁶ After the manner os the giants.” Observe that modo is
here employed, not more, because the giants warred against heaven
only once. (Compare Apollodorus, i., 6, l; Horat„ od.. iii„ 4, 49,
seqq.) Ochsner calls our attention to the inverted nature os this
sentence, instead of quid eet onim aliud natura repugnare m'oi gigan·
tum modo bellare cum diis.
