Neque enim attentionis, duc. Laelius here alludes to the doctrines
os the Epicureans, which had not long before this been introduced
at Rome. We must not therefore, as some do, refer the term nuper
to Epicurus himself, since he flourished about two centuries before
Lamus—Plus apud me antiquorum, διο. He advances here two ar-
guments in favor of the immortality of the soul, one derived from
the opinion of the early Romans, the other from the authority of
the Pythagoream as well as of Socrates—Tam religiosa jura.
“Rights so sacred iu their nature,” i. e., the right os burial, ὄιο.
(Compare Tute. Disp„ i., 13.)—N2·J2il ad eos pertinere. “ That noth-

way concerned in these—Vel eorum qui in hac terra suerunt. Re-
ferring to the Italic or Pythagorean school, who not only believed
in the immortality‘ of the seul, but in its migration into various
bodies—Magnam Groeciam. Magna Groecia was an appellation

which the Academics asterward moulded into their ἐποχή, οι· suspeu-
sion ofjudgment.—Sed idem. Some editors add dicebat aster idem,
and omit it in the previous clause—Reque. Valckenaer conjectures

Quasi presagire& “As if he bad a presentiment of his approach-
ing sate.”-Philus. L. Furius Philus ie meant, who was consul
Rc. 136, with Sextus Atilius Serranus. A contemporary os the
younger Scipio and of Laelius, Philus participated with them in a
love for Greek literature and refinement. He was particularly cel-
ebrated for the purity with which he spoke his mother-tongue. He
is introduced by Cicero as one of the speakers in his work Dc Re-
