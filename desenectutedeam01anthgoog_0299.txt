attach upon Cicero hy proposingp law to 'the effect that whoever
had taken tho life of a citizen uncondemned and without a trial,
should he interdicted fnum fire and water. Cicero here committed

a fatal misuka. Instead os assuming the hold front os consciens in-
nocense, h'e at once took guilt unto himself, und, without awaiting

, the progress ofevsnta, changed his attim, and, assuming the gar-b

os ona accused, went round the sorum soliciting the compassioni of
all whom he met.

For a brief period publio sympsthy was awakened. A large num-
her or the senate and the equites appeared also in monning, and
tho better portion of tha citizens seemed resolved to espouse his
cause. But all demonstrations of such feeling were promptly re·
pressed by the new consuls, Piso und Gabinius, who from the first
displayed steady hostility, having been bought, as above stated, by
the promises of Clodius. The rahble were insuriated hy the inces-

to the distance os four hundred miles from Rome. Clodius added
the clause, that no proposition should ever be made sor reversing
the decr-ee till those whom Cicero had put to death should come to

graven on brass. ⁸ On the sume day, the consuls Gabinius and Piso
had the provinces of syris and Macedonia assigned to them, with
extraordinary powers. Clodius· next rid himself of M. Cato, who,
by a decree passed on his motion, was sent with the powers of
praetor to take possession of the Island of Cyprus, with the treasure
