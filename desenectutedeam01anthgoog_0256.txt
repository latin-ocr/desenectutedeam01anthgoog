Impediat rhagnas utilitates amicorum. “May prove preJudicial to
important interests of our friends‚” i. a, may prove extremely pre-
judicial to their interest& -- Trofam Neoptolemus capere potuisset.
According to the legend, it had been prophesied by Helenus that
Neoptolemus, otherwise called Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, and
Philoctetes with the arrows of Hercules, were necessary for the
taking of Troy. (Sepla, Phil„ 115.) Lycomedes, king of seyme,
the maternal grandfather of the young warrior, wished to prevent
him from going to the Trojan war. Lange and Ernesti find a diffi-
culty here, since what is stated in the present passage respecting
Neoptolemus, is, as these critice maintain‚ said elsewhere of Achil-
les. The objection, however, is a feeble one, inasmnch as the pres·
ence of both father and son was necessary sor the capture of the city.

Quasi quadam calamitas. ‘⁶ A kind of calamity, as it were.” Ob-
serve that quasi is here added, because calamitas properly denotes
a storm that lays low the stalks (calami) of corn—In dimittendis.
“In renouncing.’'-Ad vulgares amicitias. “To ordinary friend-
ships,” i. e.. to that lower species of friendships which occur in the
ordinary intercourse of the world. 1t is in these alone that such a

‘⁸ calamitas” can occur, since the nobler alliances of the wisc and -

good· admit no rupture of the kind. Hence the peculiar force of
enim at the beginning of the clause, and also of the expression oratio
nostra ‹lambitat—Remissioris usus. ‘⁴ By a gradual cessation of ing
timacy.”—Dissuendce magis· quam discindendae. ‘⁴ To be unstitched
rather than cut asunder‚” i. e.‚ are to be dropped gradually rather
than broken off suddenly.
