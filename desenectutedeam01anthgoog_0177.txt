good thing which is yours,” i. e., make good use os that gifl: of

parture eost yon a sigh.-AEcatis. ‘⁴ Os human life.’'-Sua tempes-
tivitas. ‘⁴ Its proper and distinguishing characteristic.‘' Tempesti-
υἰεω, as here employed, is well explained by Graevius as ‘⁴ Cujus-
libet amic naturalis proprietas, sicut, in ordine anni, veris tempestivi-
tati flores, astatis mutu, auctumni maturitas, hiemis frigus est datum
et assignamus a natura.”-Ferocitaae. ‘⁴ Rash presumption,” i. e., a ‘

ι., if he sets out, dte. The meaning of the whole sentence is, that
