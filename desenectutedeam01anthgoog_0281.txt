ture of the action, that makes thie distinction? vi. e„ the distinction
lies in the motive, not in the nature os the actione—*Qua quenda atro
metit, doc. ‘⁶ And when the former is added to either side, that
nido becomes the weightier of the two.” A metaphor taken from

, the operation of weighing‚ the leading idea in propensu being that

os maging, bending or inelining fbrward. hanging down, ὰο. The-
idea, therefore, is this, that it is the motive which causes the bal-

= ance to incline in this direction or in that.

Multa peecantur. ‘⁸ Many crimes are committed.” Cicero here
deviates from the principle laid down by him, and is obliged to re-
turn to what he calls popular opinion. The murder of a slave, and
an act of parricide, both proceed equally from a single impulse of
the wilh and yet one of these actione is more criminal than the

other, because there are more rights and duties violated by it. The .

atrocity of the crime, therefore, depende on the case itseli} and not
on the motiva—Qui in sede ac domo, dec. The idea ie, who has
given him a habitation, a home, and a country—Multitudine pecca—
terum. ‘⁴ In the multitude of crimes that are involved in it.'’—

’ Fingere. ‘⁴ Imagine.'’ Some read figere, and compare Horat„ Od.,

iii, 15, 2.—Modum tenere. “ Exercise a control.‘’

Extra numerum. “ Out of the proper measure.” Compare the
explanation of Wetzel: ‘⁵ Si in saltando peccavit contra leges salta-
tionid' The reference in numerus is not merely to the music, but
also to the movements of the dance as consequent thereon.—Si
ver-rus pronunciatus est, dcc. The actor is not hissed for any negli-
gent pronunciation of the line, but the line itself is hissed, and tire
· actor as the representative of the poet. Hence we have the nom-
inative with the passive verb, not si versum pronuntiavit—Omni
gestu moderatior. ‘⁴ More carefully regulated than any theatrica]
gesture.''—Aptior. ‘⁸ More exact.”-·-Tu ut in syllaba te peccasse di-
ces? ‘⁴ Will you say that you have erred as in the case osa sylla-
ble merelyv’ i. e., will you say that a fault committed in life is no
greater than that in the case of a syllable which mars the measure
of a verse 2—Poocam noa audio in nugis. ⁴⁴ I take no excuse from a
poet in matters of a trifiing nature,’' i. e.‚ where mere empty fictione
are concerned. Observe that non audio is here equivalent in effect
to non accipio excusationem—Digitio peecata dimetientem sua. A met-
aphor horrowefl from the custom, on the part of poete, of measuring
off their verses hy the aid of their fingere-Qua a· visa eunt brevi·
