which followed the long watchings in which the Brutus had been
prepared, it is equally certain that the fourth paradox bears deci-
sive evidence of having been composed before the death 'of Clodius
(Rc. 52), and the sixth before the death of Crassus (B.C. 53).
Hence we must conclude that Cicero, soon aster his arrival at Rome

from Brundisium,⁸ amused himself by adding ιο a series of rhetorical ,

tristes commenced some years before, and then dispatched the en-
tire collection to his friend. (Smith, Dice. Biogr„ vol. i.‚ p. 737.)

PROOEMIUM.

Catanen, avunculum tuum. Μ. Porcius Cato Uticensis is meant,
who was sumamed Uticensis in history, from Utica, the place wilere
he put an end to his existence. Livia, the sister of the celebrated
tribune M. Livius Drusus, was married first to M. Porcius Cato, by
whom she had Cato Uticensis; and, subsequently, to Q. Servilius
Caepi0, by whom she had a daughter, Servilia, who was the mother
of Brutus. Servilia was 'therefore Cato’s half-sisten—Loeos graves
ex philosophia tractare. ‘⁴ Is accustomed to discuss grave topics of
philosophy.” Observe that locos answers here to the Greek τόπους,
analogous to the loci communes os the rhetorical writers. The res-
erence is ιο general principles of a philosophical character, intended
to be subsequently applied to the question under debate.—Ahh0rrm-
m ab hoc usu, dcc. ‘⁸ Altogether foreign to the forensic and popu-
lar mode of speaking that we are accustomed to employ.'’ More
literally‚ ‘⁸ to our forensic and popular practice.”

Quod ιο majus ut illi. “ A thing which is the more difficult for
him.’‘ Observe that mjus is here equivalent to difficilius, or m·
jori: opem. The difficulty arose from the circumstance of his being
a Stoic‚ a school which cultivated a concise and dry mode of speak-
ing, and rejected all the ornaments of oratory. Compare Brut„
xxx„ § 114: ‘⁸ Stoicis, quorum peracutum et artie plenum orationis

ι genus scis tamen esse exile, nec satis populari ωεοπείοηὲ accommoda-

tum.”—Ea philosophia. The Peripatetic and Academic. (Compare
De Orat„ iii„ 18, 673 Brut, xxxi„ ὑ mim—Quo nou multum discre-
pent, dcc. Especially as regards the views which these two schools
entertained of the bona corporis ιι fortuna. We have given the sub-
junctive here in accordance with Zumpt, 6 556. The common text
