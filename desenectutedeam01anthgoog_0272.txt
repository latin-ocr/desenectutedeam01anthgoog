“Sectst’ Observe that heresis ιε the Greek alpecrc (from alpius to
choose” ), Latinizem end denotes a school, or sect of philosophy,
chosen in preference to others. —Dilataa In the sense of amplificat
or exornae.-Minntis iniemgatiuneidis. The Stoics were remark·
able for their nice und subtle distinctions, which degenerated, event-
ually, into mere quibbles. Compare De Fin, iv., 3, ¹7: “Pungunt
quasi aculeis interrogatiunculis angustis, quihus? dte. With regurd
to interrogatiunculis, compare the explanation of Paccioleti : “⁶ Sig-
nificat argumentationes Dialecticorum, quoe fiebant interrogando.”

§ 3.

De morte Walker and Thomas Bentley conjecture de contemnen-
da morte, because Cato was accustomed to discourse, not concern-
ing death, but concerning the contempt of it.—Seoice. ‘⁸ In accord-
ance with the principles of the Stoic sect.''—Oratoriis ornamentis
adhibitis. ‘⁸ The embellishments of oratory, however, being nt the
same time called into play by him.” Those who wish to read, with
Lambinus, nullis oratoriis ornamentis adhibitis, mistake Cicero’s
meaning entirely. Cicero always speaks of Cato as un eloquent
man (Brut, xxxi„ δια), end he merely wishes to state here, that he

Β only introduced into his orations philosophie discussions on those
points in which the Stoics did not differ very widely from other
sects. He himself, however, intends to treat of their Paradoxes,
which Cato did not do, and hence the expression feci etiam auda-
εἰμι-φασι vix in gymnasiis, dcc. “Which the Stoics prove with
difficulty in their schools and momente of leisure,” i. e.‚ find it a
difficult matter to prove either in their public disputatione, or their
hours of retirement, when seated in their studies, and reducing
their thoughts to minag-Ludens. ‘⁸ As a piece of amusement.‘’
Equivalent to ludendi causa.-—In communes locos. “ Into the form
of commonplaces‚'‘ i. e., of general propositione.

§ 4:

Et ab ipsis etiam, duc. We have inserted et on the authority of
one of the MSS. The common *reading is extremely awkward.
Graevius, who omits et, places a period aster appellantur. Bentley
conjectures appellata—Id est in sorum. These words are suspect-
ed hy some editors of being a gloss, but without any necessity.—
An alia qnoedam esset, διο. “ Whether the language of the learned
was different of its kind from that which we employ in our ha-
rangues to the people.”--Socratica. Compare the remark of Pacci-
olati: ‘⁶ Exierunt ex Schola Socratis, qui, in rebus omnibus, non vulgi

J opinionem,⁸ sed veritatem et honestatem sequebantur.” “
