(Compare Bochart, G'eogr. Sacr„ iii, 7, 163; Michaelis, Spic. Geogr.
Helm, i., 82.)—-Argantlto‘niua. He is said to have lived in the sixth
century B.C., and to have received in the most friendly manner
the Phoeaeans who sailed to his city, and to have aided them with
money. (Herod, i.‚ 163; Strah„ iii„ p. 151 ; Luciam Μαι-τοὺ.. 10.)
—Aliquid extremum. . Compare Zumpt, θ «wa—Tantum remanet.
‘⁴ That alone remains.”—-Recte sactis. As factis is properly the par-
ticiple offacio, it eorreetly takes an adverb, asin bene sactum—Quid
sequatur. ‘⁴ What.is to follow,” i. ae., what the future is to be. The
subjunctive is here employed because the sentence contains an in-
direet question. (Zumpt, <5 552.)--Quod temporis. “whatever of
time.’' Compare Gernhard: ‘⁴ quoe particula temporis universi.‘’

§ 70.

Peragenda fabula est. ⁴⁴ Is >the whole piece to be performed in.”
-Μοάο, “ Provided only.''—Ad Plaudite. ‘⁴ To the end· of the
play,” i. .e.‚ to that part where the actor exelaims to the audience
“ “Plaudite‚” i.. a, “Your plaudits‚” and which marks the conclusion
of the piece. The idea intended to be conveyed is this, that it is
sufficient sor the⁴ wise man, in whatever scene he shall make⁸his
- final exit, that he support tho character assigned him with applause.
With regard to Plaudite, observo that it eomes in as a sort os quo-
tation, and is therefore employed in a sort of substantive sense.—
Sin processeris. “113 however, you shall have advanced,” ι’. a, shall
have lived—Sigmficae. ‘⁸ Typifies.’'’-oseendic. ‘⁶ Points to.’'

§⁷1-

Ut sape dixi. Compare ehap. iii„ ᾧ 9, and chap. xviii„ § 63.-
Ante partorum bonorum, &a “The &membraneo and rich abund-
anee os benefits reaped,” i. e„ the remembranoe os a virtuosis and
abundantly happy life—Sunt habandein bonis. This is the Peripa-
tetie doetrine. The Stoios, on the contrary, maintained that all
such things were merely ἄξια, that is, had a certain worth of their
own, whereas the only good was virtue—Emori. ‘gTo die off.'’
Stronger and more emphatic here than the simple mori would· have

been—Aqua multitudine. “By a large quantity of water.”-—C‹m- “

sumtus. ‘⁸ Burned out.”-Et quasi poma. Observe that quasi, placed
bere near the beginning of the clause, has the sorceof quemadmodum.
—Cocta. ‘⁴ Ripened.’‘ For a literal translation supply solibus, or
ardore soli3.—- Vis. ‘⁴ Violence.”--In portum. “Into the harbor (of ,

lasting rest).”
