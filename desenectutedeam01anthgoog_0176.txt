the more active employments os existence, so as to settle down

me. “ To have an interview with me,'’ i. a, to call on me sor ad·
vice or assistance. —— Cui fuerim occupatus. ‘⁸ For whom 1 have
been engaged,” i. e., whom I have been prevented from seeing by
other engagements, whether real or pretended. Observe the em·
ployment of the subjunctive here, the relative being equivalent to
ue ei, in consequence of the demonstrative implied in the previous
clause, the construction being the same as nemo talis ιιάΙηιε conve·
nire me voluit, ut ei fuerim occupatus. (Zumpt, § 558.)

Ne vos quidem. “Not even you, indeed,” i. e.‚ not even you two,
indeed, much less those that are weaker than you. -T. Pontii This
Titus Pontius is mentioned also in the treatise de Finibus (i., 3), but
nowhere else. The Romans generally selected sor centurione the
strongest and tallest men. (Vaga, ii„ 14.)-Moderatio modo virium,
dcc. ‘⁴ Let there only be a proper exercise os one’s strength.” Ja-
cobs and many others err when they regard moderatio virium as
equivalent here to “a moderate degree of strength ;'’ it is rather
sapiens virium unu, as Wetzel correctly explains it. Compare
also Nauck: “Mami muse nur recht hau-thalem mit dm Kraften.''
(Neue Jahrb„ 12‘ supp. vol., p. 564.)

Olympi‘oe. ‘⁴ At Olympia.” Olympia, in Elis, was the place sor
holding the celebrated Olympio games. It was not a city, but the
name was given to the aggregate of temples, altars, and other
structures on the banks os the Alpheus, in the immediate vicinity '
of the place where the games were held—Per stadium ingressus

esse, dre. ‘⁶ To have advanced along the whole length os the race-
course, supporting on his shoulders‚” dcc. The stadium was 600

Greek feet, or 606} English—Cum sustineret. This construction
may be neatly rendered in most cases by the English participle.—
Bovcm vivum. The epithet vivum, omitted in some editions, is re-
quired to impart an additional idea of weight. The story, as com-
monly told, makes the animal to have been a heifer os four years
old, and adds, that Milo ate the whole'os it in a single day. (Com-
pare Quintil., i., 93 Cic„ de Fut„ 133 Ptin.. H. N„ vii , 2⁰3 Val.
Max„ ix.‚ 12, 9.)

Pythagorae. Cicero appears to have selected the name of this
philosopher on the present occasion, because he lived in Crotona
at the same time with Milo. (Val. Max„ viii, 7, exe. 2. Compare
