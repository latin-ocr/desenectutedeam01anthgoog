enjoy.'’ By opes is here meant influence or credit in the state ; by
copias, on the contrary, private resources. Plutarch describes these
last as very extensive· ‘⁸ When,” he observes, ‘⁴ Cato’s desire of·
wealth iucoeased, and he found agriculture rather amusing than
profitable, he turned his thoughts to surer dependeuces, and em-
ployed his money in purchasing ponds, hot baths, places proper sor
fullers, and estates in good condition having pasture-ground and
wood-lands. From these he derived a great revenue, ⁴ such a one,’
he used te say, ⁴ as Jupiter himself could not disappoint him os.’ ”
(Plut., Vit. Cat. Maj., c. 21.)

Est istuc quidem, Lali, aliquid, duc. ‘⁴ There is something, I ad-
mit, Lrelius, in what you say, but it by no means covers the whole
ground.” Literally, ⁴⁴ That remark of yours, Laelius, is indeed some·
thium but all things are by no means contained in that.’‘ Observe
here the usual employment of iste to indicate what appertains to
the person spoken to. (Zumpt, ο lvo-Seriphio cuidam. “, To a-
certain native of Seriphos.” This was a small and unimportant
island in the AEgean Sea, south of cythnos, and now called Ser-pho.
It is known in mythology as the island to which the ark, or coffer,
containing Danae and her infant son Perseus, was carried. The
insignificance of the island of Seriphos caused its namo to pass into
a proverb. · (Compare Cic„ N. D„ 1, 313 Aristoph, Aeliam, 541,
and the scholiast ad loc.) The story related in the text is taken
from Plato (Rep, i. ,.p 329, E. ), andis related also by Plutarch ( Vit-
nemin„ c. 18).

Nec hercule inquit, &c The point of this reply is sometimes mis-

understood or not fully perceived. The meaning of Themistocles ’
is this :⁶ You say right, Ι do owe much to my country, and so much,
in fact, that, if Ι had been born in Seriphos, I would never have be-
come celebrated. At the same time, however, I can assure you that
I do not owe all to my country.' Yon, however, are so thoroughly
contemptible in your-sels (setting your insignificant country out of the
question), that, had you been born even at Athena, you would never
have attained celebrity at all.'’ In this way he attacks not only the
meanness of the manfs native island, but the mean spirit and stu·
‘ pidity of the individual himself. (Compare Wetzcl, ad lom—Nobilis
. . . clarus. Plutarch, in relating the story, employs the term ἐνόο-
ξοςς Plato, however, has the more expressive ὀνομαστός, which
comprehends both “ nobilitatem μηκέθ and ‘⁴ claritudinem facto·
rum,” and which Cicero, therefore, expresses here by both nobilis
aud οἱαηιε. (Gornltard, ad loc.) ’
