has enjoyed.”—Barbaaeulos mullos exceptantem. duc. ‘⁸ Taking from
the fich-pond and handling the bearded mullets.” The fish here
meant is the red mullet (Mullus barbatus, Linn.)‚ celebrated for its
ssavor, and sor the high estimation in which it was held by the Ro-
man epicurea, who were in the habit, according to Varro, os pre·
serving it in artificia! wetere, as one os the most convincing proofs
of their individual wealth. They were accustomed to seed it
from the hand, and took great delight‚ also, in watching over the
fish while dying, as the bright red color os its healthy statespassed
through various shades of purple, violet, bluish‚ and white, while
lise was gradually receding. (Senem, Quasi„ iii., 17.) So extrava-
* gant was the solly of the Romans with regard to this fish, that they
often gave sor them immense prices. Martial mentions one of four
pounds weight‚ which had cost thirteen hundred sesterces (x.‚ 31,
3); and, according to Suetonius, three mullets were sold in the
time os Tiberius for thirty thousand sesterces. (Suet, Tib„ 34.)
Pliny (H. N„ ix„ 17, 31) says that one was sold under Caligula
for eight thousand. (Gnffith'e Gravia, vol. x.‚ p. 277.)-Muroena-
rum. The muroena, or ‘⁸ lamprey,” is a species os eel (Muraena
Helena, Lina). The Linnaean name has arisen from the remark
of Athenaeus, that it was the ‘⁶ Helen‚” or choicest dish at banquets.
The muraenae were caresully reared by the Romans in their fish-
ponde, and were held in high estimation not only on account of
their ssavor, but also because they were taught to come at the
sound of their master’s voice and seed from his hand. (martial, x.,
3⁰3 Plin., H. Ν., ix., 55.)
