hie house on φο Palatino, and destroyed hin villae at Tusculum and
Formiae. The greater part of the property carried off from them
was divided between the two consula. The ground on which the
Palatine house stood, with euch os the property aa etill remained‚
was put up to.auction. Clodius wished to become the purchaaer
os it, and, not liking ιο bid himself, got a needy follow named Scato
to bid for him. He wished ιο erect on the Palatino a palme os eur·
passing aize and magnificence A short time before thie, he had
purchased the house os Q. Seius Postumus, after poisoning 'the
owner, who had refused to eell it. This it was his intention to
unite with another honae which he already had thero. He puued
down the portico of catulus, which adjoined Oioero'e grounds, and
erected another in ite place with hia own name inscribed on it. Το

occupied by a chapel ιο the goddess. For the image of the goddess
he made use of the statue os a Tanagram lietera, which hia brother
Appius had brought from Greece. To maintain the armed bande '
whom he employed, Clodius required large suma of monem but
this he did not find much difficulty in procui-ing: for with the pop-
ulace he was all-powerthl, and hie influence made hie favor worth
purchaeing. He went so far ae to offend Pompey by aiding the
escape of Tigranes, eon of the king os Armenia, whom Pompey had
brought a prisoner ιο Rome.. In thie instance hie eervices were
purchased. Pompey, however, did not feel himself strong enough
to reeent the insult. Clodius soonassailed him more openly. The
consul Gabinius eided with Pompey. Frequent conflicta took place
between the armed band os the tribune and the consul, in one of
which Gabinius himself was wounded and his fasces broken. Clo-
dius and the tribune Ninnius went through the farce of dedicating
ιο the gode, the one the property of Gabinius, the other that of Clo·-
dius. An attempt was made by Clodius, through one os hie slaves,
upon the lise of Pompey, who now withdrew to his own house, and
kept there as long aa hie enemy was in office. Clodius stationed a
body of men, under hia freedman Darnis, ιο watch him, and the
praetor Flavius was repulsed in an attempt ιο drive them off.
