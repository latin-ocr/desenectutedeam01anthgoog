aster an interval of ten years. As twelve years, therefore, had elap-
sed since Scipio’s first consulship, he is said in tho text to have ob-
tained the second one ‘⁶ suo temporae.”

Ante tempus. “Before the legal period,'' i. e., the age of sorty-
three.—Sibi suo ,tempor-e. ‘⁶ At the proper period, as far as regards
himself,” i. a, aster the regular interval prescribed bylaw.—Rei1mb-
licoe paene sero. “ At one almost too late for the republic‚” i. e.. in
consequence os the disgrace which the successful defence of N u-
mantia, now in the eighth year of its siege, had brought upon the
Roman arms—De movibus facillimis. ‘⁴ Of his most affable man-
ners.’'—-Pietate in mtrem. He presented his mother Papiria, aster
her divorce from his father, with the inheritance which he had re-
ceived from AEmilia, his adoptive grandmother‚ and the widow of
Africanus the Elder.-—-Liberalitate in sorores. Aster the death of Pa·
pitia, when the inheritance which he had bestowed on her came
back to him, he presented it to his two sisters.—Bonitate in suos.
‘⁶ Of his kindness toward his male relatives.” As one instance of
this, he'bestowed on his elder brother, Q. Fabius Maximus, his own
share of his paternal inheritance. (Cia, Parati„ vi., 2.)—Paucomm
annorum accessio. He was about fifty-six years old at the time of
his death—Eam viriditatem. ‘⁴ That freshness.” The conversation
to which Laelius alludes forms the subJect of the De Senectute.

Vel fortuna vel gloria. ⁸⁶ Whether in-point os fortune or of glory.”
Compare Wetzel, ‘⁴ sive fortunam spectas, sive gloriam.''-Moriendi
autem sensum, dic. Aster some violent debates relative to the dis-
tribution of the public lands, in which Scipio opposed the popular
party, he went quietly home, accompanied by the senate, and a great
number of Latins and Roman allies. In the evening he went into
his bedroom with the intention of writing a speech to be delivered
the following morning. But in the morning he was found dead in
his bed. An investigation into the cause of his death was prevented
by the multitude, and the event remained a secret. Public opinion
pointed out many who were suspected of having murdered him, and
the heaviest suspicion feu upon Papirius Carbo. (Appian, Bell.
Cim, i., 19, &c.)—Populo Romano. Not the lower ordene, but the
wealthier and more distinguished portion of the commone, or, in
other worda, the “ boni cives.''— Ut ea: tam alto dignitatis modu, die.
Laelius means that there was but a step, as it were,¹ from Scipio’s
elevated station to the skies.
