reading than reverebantur, as given by some. The distinction be-

quorum imperata, ut ingenui homine-5, facimus, ue liberi parentum.”—

Ita. ‘⁸ In this way.” Ita, when followed, as here, by si, is equiv-
alent to hoc modo, or, more freely, hac conditione, and not, as some
grammar-iaus maiatum, to tum demum. (Consult Hand, ad Tur-rell„
iii., p. 4⁷8.)-Si se ipsa defendit. ‘⁴ If it maintains its own author·
5373’ Literally, ‘⁸ if it defends itself.”-- Si nemini mancipata est.
‘⁴ 11· it has been brought under no one’s control.'‘ Some editions
give emancipata est, a much inferior reading. Orelli and Madvig
have mancipata est, in accordance with the constant usage of Gaius.
(Consult‚ also, Gronov„ Obs. in Ecce„ p. 34, as cited by Orelli, ad
loc.)—-Dominatur in suos. ‘⁴ It preserves its proper ascendency over
the member-s of one’s household.” Consult Gernhard’s note in de?
fence of this reading, against the objections of Groevius.

Originum. The reference is to Cato’s historica] work entitled·
the ‘⁴ Origines,” of which mention has already been made. The
second and third books treated of the origin of the Italian towns
and communities, and from these two books the whole work de-
rived its title. The sixth and seventh books continued the narra·
tive to the year os Cato’s death. (Nepos, Vic. Cat. Maj„ 3.)-Εει .,

(Compare cic„ Ep. ad Ate„ iv., 13, seqq.,· Veratius, de Lat. falso

be particularly to the ἀποφθέγματα, terse and pointed sayings, of
which Cato is known to have published a collection. (Cia, De Off,
i., 29.)--Num· quam mxime conficio. “I am nour, with all possible
industry‚ putting the finishing hand to,‘’ i. a, I am now, with all
possible industry, preparing for publication. Cato lest behind him

Cicero, though almost entirely neglected. Only a few fragments
