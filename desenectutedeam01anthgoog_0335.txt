LIFE ΔΗΒ ΟΗΑΒΑΟΤΕΒ, OF AFRICANUS
THE YOUNGER.¹

P. connun- Scmo AEnumua Atacinus Minoa, son os L.
AEmiliue Paulus, and adopted son os P. Cornelius Scipio (son of
Africanus the Rider), munt have been born about 185 ΒΕ. ; for in
1oe Rc„ being then a youth in hia neventeenth year, he took a
very aetite part in the battle of Pydna, in which his father defeated
Peraean, king of Macedonia. (Ida, xliv„ 443 Plana, Vit. AEm„ Peml.⁹

are recorded: he was the only Roman who ventured to accept the
challenge of a hage Spanish chief, whom he slew in single combat.
He was also the first to scale the walls of the town of Interca-
tia while it was besieged by the Romans. These proofs of per-
