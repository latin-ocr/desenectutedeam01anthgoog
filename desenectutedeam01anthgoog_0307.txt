housebold. He worked silver mines, cultivated farma, and built
houses, which he let· at high rents. He took advantage of the dis-
tresses and dangers of others to make cheap purchases. Was there
a fite in the city, Crassus might be seen among the tnrong, bargain-
ing sor the houset that were burning or in danger os being burned.

From such pursuits Crassus was called—to action by that servile
war, which sprang from and indicated the deplorable state of domes-
tic lise in Italy, and was signalined by the romantio adventures and
reversas of the daring, but iu-sated Spartacus. Spartacus had sor
many months successfully resisted the generals who had been⁴ sent
to oppose him. A revolt so really dangerous had begun to create
alarm, and no confidence was placed in the military talents of the
consuls sor the year B.C. ⁷1, who regularly, according to a still pre-
vailing enatem, would have divided between them the command of
the army. But the occasion called for more experienced leaders,
and, in the absence of Pompey, who was fighting in Spain, the com-

mand os six legions and os the troops already in the field was given ·

to Crassus, who was created praetor. Aster several engagements,
fought with various success, Crassus at length brought the rebel
chief to a decisivo battle in Lucania. Spartacus was alain, with
twelve thousand three hundred (Plan, Vit. Pomp„ 21), or, according
to Livy (lipia, 97), sixty thousand os his followers; and, of the
slaves that were taken prisonem, six thousand were crucified along
the road between Rome and Capua. Crassus had hastened oper· ᾖ
ations in order to anticipate the arrival os Pompey, who, he seared‚
might reap the credit, without having shared the dangers os the
campaign. His fears were in some degree verified; sor Pompey
came in time to cut off five thousand fugitives, aud wrote to the
senate, ‘⁴ Crassus, indeed, has defeated the enemy, but I have ex·
tirpated the war by the roots.” Though the victory of Crassus was
of great importance, yet, „aa being achieved over slaves, it was not
thought worthy of a triumph; but Crassus was honored with an
ovation, and allowed the ‘distinction of wearing a triumphal crown
os hay (lauras), instead of the myrtle, which was appropriate to an
ovation. .

Crassus now aspir-ed to the consulship, and was not above apply÷
ing for assistance to his rival Pompey, who had also announced
himself a candidate. Pompey assumed with pleasure the part os
protector, and declared to the people that he should consider his
own election valueless unless it were accompanied with that of
Crassus. Both were elected (BC. 70). Already had Pompey be-
come a savorite of the people, and already begun to incur the dis-
