EXGURSUS Ι.

LfflE ΛΝΒ CHARACTER oF eitonam.¹

P. Cnomus Puteum was the youngest eon of Appius Claudius
Pulcher, who in Rc. 82 marched with Sulla against Rome, and
met his death near the city. (Plan, Viae. Sul.. 29.) The form of
the name Clodius was not peculiar to him; it is occasionally found
in the case of others of the gens (Orelli, Ζωστῆρι, 579); and Glo-
dius was himself sometimes called Claudius. (Dio cm.. xxxv„
14.) He first makes his appearance in history in Rc, 70, eervinss
with his brother Appius under his brother-in-law‚ L. Lucullus, ‘in
'Asia Displeased at not being treated by Lucullus with the dis·
tinction he had expected, he encouraged the soldiers to mutiny.
He then lest Lucullus, and betook himself to his other brother-in·-
lawa. Marcius Rex, at that time proconsul in Cilicia, and was in-
trusted by him with the command os the fleet. He fell into the
hands os the pirates, who, however, dismissed mm without ransoxfi,
through sear of Pompey. He next went to Antiochia, and joined
the Syrians in making war against the Arabiane. Here, again, he
excited some os the soldier-s to mutiny, and nearly lost his life. He
now returned to Rome, and made his first appearance in civil affaire
in Rc, 65, by impeaching Catiline for extol-tion in his government
of Africa. Catiline, however, bribed his accuser aad judge, and
escaped.

In ΒΟ. 64, Clodius accompanied the propraetor L. Muraena to
Gallia Transalpina, where he resorted to the most nefarions meth-
ods of procuring money. His avarice, or, the want to which his
dissipation had reduced him, led him to have recoursc to similas
proceedings on his returnto Rome. Asconius (in Mil„ p. 50, Orell.)
says that Cicero osten charged him with having taken part in the
conspiracy os Catiline; but, with the exception os some probably
exaggerated rhetorical alfusions (De-Hamp. Reap„ 33 pro Mil„

14), no intimation of the kind appears in Cicero, and Plutarch (Υἱὲ.
Cic„ 29) says that ou that occasion he took the side of the consul,
and was still on good terms with him.
