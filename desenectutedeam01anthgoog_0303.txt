referring to the restoration occicero’s house, and made it a handle ἦ
sor s fresh sttack upon him. Cicero replied in the speech De Ha-
ruspicum Responde. By this time, Pompey aud Clodius had found
it convenient to make common cause with each other. A fresh ξ
attach, which Clodius soon aster made on Cicero's house, was re·
pulsed by Milo. With the assistance os the latter, also, Cicero, ,3
after being once foiled in his attempt by Clodius and his brother,
succeeded, during the absence of Clodius, in carrying off from ,the
Capitol the tablets onnwhich the laws os the latter were engraved.

Clodius actively supported Pompey aud Crassus when they be- ⁴
came candidates for the consulship, to which they were elected in ,
tho beginning of nc. 55, and nearly lost his nse indoing so. He ’
appears to have been, in a guest measure, led by the hope os being
appointed on an embassy to Asia, which would give him the oppor-
tunity of recruiting his almostssexhausted pecuniary- resources‚ and Τ
’ getting from Brogitarus, aud some others whom he had assisted, the
reward: they had promised him for his services. It appears, how· ³
, ever, that he remained in Rome. We hear nothing more os him 3
this year. In Rc. 54, we find him prosecuting the err-tribune Pro· ἐ
cilius, who, among other acts os violence, was charged with mur- f
der; and, soon after, we find Clodius and Cicero, with four others,
appear-ing to defend Μ. AEmilius Scaurus. Yet it appears that
Cicero still regarded him with the greatest apprehension. (Cic, ad
Act„ iv„ 153 aa Q. Fr„ ῆι, 15, b.,· iii, 1, 4.)

In B.C. 53, Clodius was a candidate sor the praetorship, and Milo
for the consulship. Each strove to hinder the election os the other. ἢ
They collected armed hands of slaves and gladiatore, and the streets
, of Rome beccum the scene of fresh tumults and stays, in one of ¹
which Cioero himself was endangered. When the consuls endeav-
ored to hold the comitia, Clodius fell upon them with his band, and r
one os them, Cu. Domitius, was wounded. The senate met to de· ’
liberate. Clodius spoke, and attached Cicero and Milo, touching‚

 

among other things, upon ’the amount of debt with which the latter 2

was burdened. Cicero replied iu the speech De AEre Alieno Milonis.
The contest, however, was soon aster brought to a sudden and vio-
lent end. On the tweutieth es January, B.C. 52, Milo set out on a
journey to Lanuvium. Near Bovillae he met Clodius, who was re-
turuing to Rome after visiting some os his property. Both were
accompanied-hy armed followers, but M ilo's party was the stronger.
The two antagonists had passed each other without disturbance;
hut two os the gladiatore in the rear of Milo's troop picked a quar-rel
with some os the followers os Clodius, who immediately turned
