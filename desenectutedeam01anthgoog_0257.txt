Because the truly wisc never allow such matters to interrupt their

after having promised Scipio that he would aid the application os
Lelius sor the consulship, he got himself appointed consul. (Plus,
Apophth„ c. 21.)—Quoe erat in republica. “Which existed at that
time in relation to public affairs.” The quari-el between Scipio and
Metellus (Q. Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus) appears from this to

have been occasioned by politica] differences, not by any private
cause. It arose probably when Metellus espoused the cause of L.

Cotta, who had been accused by Africanus. (Bruta, 21, cim—Colle-

adopted, in the clause auctoritem et offensione animi non acerba, the
explanation of Seyffert, who regards it as epexegetical of graviter.
As regards the circumstance itself to which the text alludes, it may
be remarked, that Metellus also, on his part, conducted his opposi-
tion ιο Scipio without any bitterness er malice, and that he was one
os the first at his death to recognize and acknowledge his greatness.
