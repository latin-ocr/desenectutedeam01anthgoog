P. Cornelius Cethegus, the friend os Marius, and a man os notori-
ously bad lise. He retained, however, great power and influence
aster 'Sulla's death, whose party he had espoused in Rc. 83, after
abandoning that es Marius; and Lucullus did not disdain to entreat
his concubine to use her interest in his favor when he was secking
to obtain the command of the war against Mithradates. (Plan,
Lucull„ v„ ὃς compare Cic„ pro Οἶμαι, 31.)—Ampliuimi. “Men
of the highest standing.”—-Excessit. ⁴⁶ Has departed,” i. ι., has
ceased.—Adolescentibus paullo loquacioribus, dre. “ One must, then,
be a slave to young men a little more talkative than ordinary.” The
allusion is to young meu who fancy themselves eloquent, but who
are, in reality, talkative rather than eloquent, and who seek some
opportunity os making their imagibed powers of oratory known by
accusing* some great criminaL Unto these the individual referred
to in the text must bend the knee in abject submission, and strive
to propitiate their ravon—Qui aliquid scire videntur. “ Who appear
to know any thing (respecting him),’' i. e., to be privy to any os his
misdeeds.—-Jude2:. Lambinus prefers Index. But compare De Lag„
i., 14, 41 ε “ Nihil timet nisi testem et judicem ,·'’ and also Parad„ ii,

L. Crassi' copiosa magis, dcc. The allusion is to the speech of
L. Licinius Crassus, the celebrated orator, in favor os the Lex Ser-
vilia (Ro, 106), by which it was proposed to restore‘to the equites
the privilege of furnishing judices fer public trials, which was then
in the hands of the senatorian order, The speech of Crassus on
this occasion was one os remarkable power and eloquence, and ex-
pressed the strength os his devotion to the aristocratic party; but
Cicero finds fault with it, both here and elsewhere (De Orat„ i., 52),
as having been couched in too sawning a tone towards the people,
and one calculated to lower the character of the senatorial order
with the wise and the good—Eripite nos ex servitute. The passage ,
is quoted more fully and consecutively in the De Orat„ i., 52. The
allusion in servitute is to the various acts of injustice toward the sen·
atorian order of which the equestrian Judices had been guilty, and
which are compared to the yoke of a regular servitude-Omnis
. animi debilitati, dre. ‘⁶ Any kind of apprehension on the part of a
dispirited, and sels-abasing‚ and timid mind is so much slavery.”
-Ῑπ libertatem vindicari. “ To be set free (from any yoke).'’—Nisi
*vobis universis. “ Unless to you conectively‚” i. e.‚ to be slaves to

the whole people, not merely tofi single order, namely‚ the equites.
