that would have ensued.
In the whole intercourse between Crassus and Cicero may be

, ohserved a real coldness, with occasional alternatione os affected

friendship‘. In his intercourse with others, Crassus was equally un·
steady in his likiugs and eumities. They were, in fact, not deeply
seated, and, without the practice ol* much hypocr-iay, could be as-
sumed or withdrawn, as temporary expediency might suggest. It
was from motives of sels-interest, without actual community- os feel-
ing or purpose, that the so-oalled triumvir-ate was formed between
Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus. Each hoped to gain the first place
for himself by using the others for his purposes, though there cun
be no doubt that the consedet-acy was really most profitable =to
Caesar, and that, of the three, Crassus would have been the least
able to rule alone. Caesar had already found Crassus a convenient
friend3 sor in Rc. 61, when Caesar was about to proceed ,to his
⁵ province in Fur-ther Spain, Crassus became security for his debts to s
alai-ge amount. It may, at first vieW, excite surprise, that a person

consider-ing that the ² character os Crassus represented, ’in many
points, a large portion of the public. While the young, the daring,
and the ambitione, the needy, the revolutionary, and the democratic,
adhered to Caesar—while the aristocracy, ’the party os the old con-
stitution, those who affected the reputation os high principle and
steady virtue, looked with greater favor upon Pompey—there was
a considerable mass of plain, moderate, practical· men, who saw
much that they liked in Crassus. Independently os the actual in-
fluence which he acquired by the means we have explained, he had
the sympathy of those who, without being noble, were jealous of
the nobility, and were rich, or were occupied in making money.

, They sympathized with him because the love of gain was a strong

trait in the Roman character, and they saw that his unequivocal
success in his pursuit was a proos of at least one unquestionable
talent-——a taient os the most universal practical utility. He was not
without literary acquirement, for, under the teaching os the Peri·
patetic Alexander, he had gained a moderate proficiency in history
end philosophy: There was no profligacy in his private conduct to
shock decent and respectable mediocrity. He was not above ordi-
nary comprehensim. The many could appreciate a worldly and
