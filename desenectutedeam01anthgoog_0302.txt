ward, he assaulted Cicero himself, and compelled him to take refuge
in a neighboring house. Next day he attached the house os Milo,
situated on the eminence called Germalus, but was driven off by Q.
Flaccus. When Marcellinus proposed in the senate that Clodius
should be brought to justice, the friends of the latter protracted the
discussion, so that no decisiou was made.

Clodius was at this time a candidate for the aedileship‚ that, if
successful, he might be screened from prosecution3 and threatened
the city with fire and ‚sword if an assembly were not held sor his
electiori. Marcellinus proposed that the senate should deeree that
no election take place till Clodius had been brought to trial. Milo
declared that he would prevent the consul Metellus from holding
the comitia. Accordingly, wheneverMetellus attempted to hold anx
assembly, he po‘sted himself with a strong body of armed men on
the place of meeting, and stupped the proceedings by giving notice
that he was observing the auspices. In the beginning os the follow-

Clodius, almost immediately after his election, impeached Milo sor
public violence. Milo appeared on ‘the second os February to an-
swer the accusation, and the day passed without disturbance. The
next hearing was fixed for the niuth, and when Pompey stood up to
defend him, Clodius's party attempted to put him down by raisiug
a tumult. Milo’s party acted in a similar manner when Clodius
spoke. A fray ensued, and the judicial proceedings were stopped
for that day. The matter was put off, by several adjournments, to
the beginning of May, from which time we hear nothing more of it.
In April, Clodius celebrated the Megalesian games, and admitted
such a number of slaves that the free citizens were unable to find
room. Shortly after this, the senate consulted the haruspices on
some prodigies which had happened near Rome. They replied,
that, among other things which had provoked the anger of the gods,
was the desecration of sacred places„ Clodius interpreted this as
