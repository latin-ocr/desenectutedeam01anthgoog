in the fisth book of the Tuscula Disputations, under the title ⁴· Vir· ·

tutem ad beate vivendum se ipsa osse contentam. ’'—Nec. vero ego, dcc.
Some editors, in order to avoid tha appearance of abruptness in this
commencement, suppose the present Paradox to be intimately con-
nected with, and to flow, as it were, from the preceding one. It is
better, however, to regard the whole piece as a fragment from an
oration against Clodius, who had attacked Cicero on account of tho
alleged illegality of the condemnation os the followers of Catiline;
and as being here introduced for the pprpose os showing in what way
general propositione, of a philosophical nature, may be made to have
a special application. (Compare Billerbeck, ad ἂνω-Μ. Regulum.
Compare De Seneca, xx„ 9 75. Cicero appears nowhere to have

had any doubts respecting the actual punishment of Regulus by the ff
Carthaginians.—Magnitudo animi. ‘⁶ His losty spirit.”—Gravitas. l

‘⁴ His rectitude os principle,” i. e., his remaining true to his char·
aeter, and not allowing himself to be intimidated by the sear of a

cruel punishment, so as to recommend impolitic and dishonorable ,
terma to his countrymen. — Qui, tot virtutum prasidio, dcc. ‘⁵ For ³

he, through the saseguard and the glorious retinue of so many vir· ¹

tues.” There is no need os our inserting septus, or circumseptus, .

οι· munitus into the text, aster comitatu, as some editors have done ;
for prasidio and comitatu are causal ablatives, and require nothing ἵ
to be added.

Ο. vero Marium vidimus. Marius died Bc. 86, when Cicero was f
in his twenty-first year. The works os Cicero offer many prooss os
his attachment to the memory of Marius. While still a young man,

he celebrated his praises in a poam named aster him. (Dc Lag„ i., ,
l.) He coustantly cites him as a model os ceurage and firmaess of =

ocul. (Or. in Vera, ν., 1ος pro Rath.. 2⁰, αξη· in slim, 193 Tusa, ἢ

ii„ 153 De Fin„ it, 32, dm.) He compares his, own exile to that ᾖ

of Marius (Post red. ad Quen, ες pro Sext„ 22„ aud he mentions, ³
