erum et gravem. ‘⁴ A firm, inflexible, and influentia] man.” Ob-
serve that here, as elsewhere, the idea of weight of character lies
at the basis of the term pavis, which is opposed to levis in the pre-
vious clause.

G. Papirius. C. Papirius Carbo is meant, who has already been
referred ιο in chap. xi, ᾧ 39, and chap. xii, § 41. Aster the word
Papirius the common text adds consul, which Lange and other edi-
tors very correctly remove, as a mere interpolation. Carbo was
not consul, but tribune, when he proposed the law in question,
which was in A.U.C. 622, about two years before the present con-
versation is supposed to have taken place. He did not obtain the
consulship until A.U.C. 634; so that the common reading can not
be correct—De tribunis plebis reficiendis. “ About the re-election
- of tribunes of the commous.” The law here referred to provided
that a person might be re-elected to the tribuneship as often as the
people thought advisable. It was supported by Caius Gracchus,
but strenuously opposed by the younger Africanus, and was defeat-
ed.—Nilzil de me. Supply dico.

Ducem populi Romani, dcc. ‘⁴ That he was the leader os the Ro·-
man people, not the mere follower of their will.” Scipio, on this
occasion, though unm ox populo, that is, though a privatus, placed
himself, by the force of his eloquence, at the head of the people, and
pointed out to them the true path, from which they were about to
wander. He became, therefore, a δημαγωγός in the highest and
noblest sense of the term, and not one of those populares whose
only object is to fiatter the feelings of the multitude, and blindly
follow their will and pleasure. (Compare Seyffert, ad loc.)

Q. Maximo. The allusion is to Q. Fabius Maximus AEmilianus,
elder son of AEmilius Paulus Macedonicus, and who had been adopted ⁸
into the Fabian family as his brother had been into that os the Scip-
ios. ¹(Compare chap. xix„ § 69.)—Comulibus. A.U.C. 6093 B.C. 145.
—C'. Licinii Crassi. This Crassus was a tribune ofthe commone
ΒΕ. 145, and proposed a law ιο prevent the colleges of priests from
filling up vacancies, and to transfer the election to the people. 'rba
measure was defeated, however, by the speech of the then praetor,
C. Laelius Sapiens. (Brut, 21.)--Ad populi beneficium transferebatur.
‘¹ W'as proposed to be transferred to the favor of the people,'’ i. e.,
the object of the proposed law was to make this a matter of popu-
lar favor at the comitia—Atque is primus instituit, &c ‘⁴ He was
. also the first that brought in the custom of addressing the people
