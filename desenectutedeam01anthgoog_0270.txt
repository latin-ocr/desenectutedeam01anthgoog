THE PARADOXA.

M. TULLII CICERONIS PARADOXA, dcc. “ The Paradoxa
of M. Tullius Cicero, addressed to Marcus Brutus.” The Brutus
here referred to is the celebrated Marcus Junius Brutus who con-
spired against Julius Coesar. ’

Under this title of Paradoaea are comprehended six fayorite para-
doxes of the Stoics, explained in familiar language, defended by
popular arguments, and illustrated, occasionally, by examples de-
rived from contemporary history, by which means they are made
the vehicles sor covert attacks upon Crassus, Hortensius, and Lu-
cullus, and for vehement declamation against Clodius. This must
not be viewed as a serious work, or one which the author viewed
in any other light than that os a mere jeu d’esprit (⁴⁴ Ego vero, illa -
ipsa, qua via: in gymnasiis et in otio Stoici probant, tudem conjeci in
communes locos‚’' praef.); for the propositione are mere philosophica]
quibbles‚ and the arguments by which they are supported are pal·
pably unsatisfactory and illogical, resolving themselves into a juggle
with words, or into induction testing upon one or two particular

cases. The theorems enunciated for demonstration are, 1. That ¹

which is morally sair (τό καλόν) is alone good (ἀγαθόν). 2. Virtue
alone is requisito to secure happiness. 3. Good and evil deeds ad·
mit of no dogm, i. e., all crimes are equally heincus, all virtuous
actions equally meritorious. 4. Every foci is a madman. 5. The
wisc man alone is free, and, therefore, every man not wise is a
slave. -6, The wisc man alone is rich.

The presace, which is >addressed to M. Brutum-must have been
written early in Bc. 463 fer Cato is spoken of in such terme that
we can not doubt that he waffstill alive, or, at all events, that in-
telligence of his fate had not yet reached 1t21y3 and there is also a
distinct allusion to the De Glari-³ Oratoribus as already publishod.
But, although the offering now presented is called a ⁶⁴ parvum opus-
culum? the result of studies prosecuted during the shorter nights
