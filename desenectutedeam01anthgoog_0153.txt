‘⁴ Cum eo quartum consule οὼζωοεπιιιὶιιε miles ad Capuam profectus
eam, quintoque anno post ad Tarentum quaem· .- deinde eduis, quadri-
ennio post sactus eum putten-3³ There is no doubt whatever that
this reading is corrupt and interpolated, since it is at variance with
the accounts both of ancient historians aad of Cicero himself. Iu
the first place, Cato was not questor at the siege os Tarentum, but
in Africa3 nor under Fabius Maximus, but Scipio Africanum and,
moreover, so far was he from being a quaestor at the siege of the
place in question, that he served on this occasion merely as a pri·
vate soldier (miles). In the next place, there is no reason whatever
why be should speak of himself, in this passage, as aedile and ρω-
tor, when his object is not to make any mention of himself, save
only so far as will enable him to tell the praises of Fabius. Again,
he did not fill the pretorship in the year when Tuditanus and Cethe-
gus were consuls, but merely the office os quaestor, a fact of which
Cicero himselfis a witness. (Brut, 15, 6.) And, finally, he was not
pretor four years aster his edileship, but the very next year. We
ought to have no hesitation, therefore, in reJecting odilis and prator
from the text, with Pighius (Annei. Rom, cul ann. 549, p. 219), and
by a change of punctuation restoring his own to Cicero. (Wetzel,
ad loc.)

Legio Cincio. The Lea: cimice, called also Mun-eratis, was passed
imthe time of the tribune M. Cincius Alimentus (Rc, 204), and not
only forbade a person to take anfi thing for his pains in plcading a
cause, but applied also to gista in general. limiting in the latter case
the amount os what a person could give, and also requiring such
gista to be accompanied by certain formalities. (Dice. Ant„ ε. υ.)

Ut adduam. “As a young man,” i. e„ with as much energy
and spirit as if he were still in early manhood. Observe that there
is no· allusion here to youthful rashness.—Grandis. Supply etate.—
Et Hannibalem juveniliter exultantem, dcc. ‘⁶ And by his patient per·
severanceecalmed down Hannibal, when exulting with all the ardor
os a youthful conqueror.” Literally, “ exulting like a young man.'’
Hannibal was about thirty years of age when he entered ltaly‚ and
in his forty-fourth year when he lest that countryand returned to
,Carthagee—Familiaris noster. When Cato, who had filled the office
of quaestor under Scipio Africanus in the war against Carthage, was
returning home, he found Ennius in Sardinia, became acquainted
with his high powers, and brought him in his train to Rome, where
he ever aster lived on terma of intimacy with Cato and other emi-
nent men of the day.
