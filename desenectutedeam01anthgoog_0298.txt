that he had misgivings as to the result. The triumvirs had not yet
taken Clodius’s side; and when he impeaohed L. Calpurnius Piso
for enm-tion, their influence procured the acquittal of the accused.
But, in desending C. Antonius, Cicero provoked the triumvir& and
especially Coesan and within three hours alter the delivery os his
speech, Clodius became the adopted son of P. Fonteius. The lex
curiata sor his adoption was proposed by Caesar, and Pompey pre-
sided in the assembly. The whole proceeding was irregular, as the
sanction of the pontifices had not been obtained. Fonteius, more·
over, was not twenty years old, and, consequently, much younger
than Clodius, and was married, nor was there the smallest reason
to suppose that his marriage would remain childless; and, indeed,
he was afterward the father os several children. The rogation, too,
was not made public three nundines before the comitia; audit was
passed, although Bibulus sent notice to Pompey that he was taking
the auspices. A report soon aster got abroad that Clodius was to
be sent on an embassy to Tigranes, and that by his refusal to go
he had provoked the hostility of the triumvirs. Neither turned out
to be true. Clodius was now actively endeavoring to secure his
election to the tribuneship. Cicero was sor a time amused with a
report that his only design was to rescind the laws os Caeam.
With the assistance of the latter Clodius succeeded in his object,
and entered upon his office in December, ΒΟ. 59.

Clodius did not immediately assail his enemies. On the last day
of the year, indeed, he prevented Bibulus, on laying down. his office,
from addressing the people3 but his first mensures were a series of
laws calculated to lay senate, equites, and people under obligations
to him. The first was a law sor the gratuitous distribution os corn
once a month to the -poorer citizens. The next enacted that no
magistrate should observe the heavens on comitial days, and that
no veto should be allowed to hindei· the passing os a law. This en·„
actment was designed specially to aid him in the attack with which
he had threatened Cicero. The third was a law sor the restoration
of the old guilds which had been abolished, and the creation of new
ones, by which means he secured the support of a large number of
- organized bodies. A fourth law was intended to gratisy those of
a higher class, and provided that the censors should not expel from
the senate, or inflict any mark of disgrace upon any one who had
not first been openly accused before them, and convicted ot· some¹
crime by their joint sentence. The consuls of the year he gained -
over to his interests by undertaking to secure to them the provinces
which they wished. Having thus prepared the way, he opened his
