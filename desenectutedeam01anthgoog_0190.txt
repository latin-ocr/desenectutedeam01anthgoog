liora! ⁴⁴ Heaven forbid !” Liternum ‘⁴ may the gods grant better

ellipsis are sacient, or velint, or serant. dte. (consult Palam, Lat.
Ellipae„ p. 63, ed. Barker. γ-Ιιιὲησ. “ From those influences to which

wa· a Roman actor, who distinguished himself in the time of Ter-
ence by the truth with which he acted his parts on the stage. His
name occurs in nearly all the didascalia os the plays os Terence,
and the later Romane mention him with Roscius and AEsopus.
(Tac, Diae. de Or., 203 Symmachus, Epist.. i., 253 1„ 2.)--Qui in
pn'm cavea spectat. ‘⁶ The spectator who witnesses the perform-
ance in the trent seats os the theatre.” More liternlly‚ “he who
gazes (upon the piece) in the ,first part of the cavea.” In the an-
cient theatree the whole of the place for the spectatore was called,
in Greek, κοῖλον; in Latin, cavea. Among the Romane, the front
neate were occupied by the senators, and immediately ⁴aster them
camo the equites. Behind the equites the great body of the people
sata—Qui in altimo. For qui in ultima cavea spectate—Propter.
“Near nt hand‚” i. a, from a near point of vieW. Observe that
propter is here employed adverbially. Many editors give prope in
place ospropter, and these two words are osten confounded togeth-
er. We have followed. however, Orelli and Madvig, and the au-
lhority of Nonius, ε. υμ-Ταπὲιιηιῑᾳιιαηιιιτη eat est. “ As much aa is
sufficient (for its more subdued desires.)”
