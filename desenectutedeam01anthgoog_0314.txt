to extreme danger on their march through sandy deserte, where
they would be unable to procura water and provisions. Crassus,
however, determined to march through Mesopotamia, and engaged
Artavasdes to supply him with auxiliary troops; but the king never
sent the promised forces, exeusing himself on the ground that they
were necessary sor his own defence. against Orodes.

crassus, in pursuing the imprudent course which he determinati
upon, was misled by a craity Arabian chiestain, called, by Plutarch,
Ariamnes; by others, Augarus, or Abgarum, or Acbarus. This
Arab had formerly ser-ved under Pompey, and was well known to
many in the army of Crassus, for which reason he was selected „by
Surenas to betray the Romans. He offered himself as a guide to
‚ conduct them, by the shortest way, to the enemy. He told the Ro-.
man general that the Parthians duret not stand before him; that
unless· he 'made haste they would escape from him, and rob him oi·
the fruita of victory. Cassius, the legate, suspected Ariamnes of
treachery, and wei-ned Crassus, instead of following him, to retii-e
to the mountain& but Crassus, deceived by his sair words and foul.
ὀᾶ by hisssattery, was led by him to the open plains of Mesopota-
mia. Ariamnes, 'having accomplished his obJect‚ seized a frivolous
pretext, and rode off to inform Surenas that the Roman army was
delivered into his hands ; and Crassus soon learned from his scduts
that the Parthians were advancing. The conduct of Crassud-in
this emergeucy 'was marked by irresolution. He first drew updhis

thian archers, and would have prevented the troops from being out·
flanked by the Parthian horse; but he then altered his mind, and
formed the infantry in a solid square, ilanked by squadrons of cav-
alry. To his son he gave one using, to Cassius· the other, and
placed himself in the ceutre. · In the battle that ensued the Par· ,
thiana exhibited their usual tactics, advancing with teri-iiic shouts
and the noise os kettle-drums. They worried the densely-marsbal-
ed Romans with showers of arrows and jevenas, every one os which
struck its man. Crassus was disheartened at finding that there was
no chance of their missiles being exhausted, as a number of carneis
rbere laden with a large supply. By reigned retreats, during which .
they continued to discharge their arreins, they led the Romans into
disadvantageous positions 3 then they suddenly rallied and charged,
