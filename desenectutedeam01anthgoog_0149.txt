Gratissimum nobie, dec. ‘⁸ You will have done a very acceptable
service to both osus, that 1 may answer for Scipio als0.” As Laelius

‘ was the elder, his age gave him this privilege. Thus we have in

the “De Amicitia” (c. 9) the following language from Fannius ε
“ Tu vero perge, Loeli5 pro hoc enim, qui minor est natu, meo jure re-
spondeo.’‘—Volumus quidem certe. “We wish‚ indeed, at least.”
Observe that volumus has here the force os desideramus—Ingraves-
eentem atatem. ‘⁸ The weight of increasing ye'ars,’' i. e., old age as
it comes on. Literally, ‘⁸ age beginning to grew heavy.’'—Si futu-
rum eet. ‘⁸ Since it is going to prove.”—Quam nobis quoque ingredi-
endum eit. “On which we also may have to enter.” The more
usual form of construction would be quoe nobis quoque ingredienda
1513 the present nse of the gerund, however, occurs also in Varro
(R. R. , iii., 3, 9, 18) : ‘⁶ Objicienclum pullis polentam,” as well as else-
where. (Consult Sanctii Miner-v„ iii., 8, and the note os Perizonius ;
and also Stallbaum, ad Rada„ ii., p. 251, n. 59.) Some editions
read qua here instead of quam‚· Cicero, however, saJS, viam or in
viam ingredi, not vim—Istuc. For istoc, from istie, ietaec, istoc, or
istuc. Not the adverb.

“of my companions in years,” i. e., of men of my own years.—
Pares autem, vetere proverbio, &cs ⁴⁴ Like, you known according to
the old saying, congregate most easily with like.” This is the
same as our common English expression, ⁸⁴ Birds of a feather fiock
together.” Compare Aristotle (Em, 8, 1), Ὅθεν τὸν ὅμοιόν φασιν
ὧς ὅμοιον, καὶ κολοιὸν ποτὶ κολοιόν, and Plato (symma, c. 18, 3), ‘O
παλαιὸς λόγος εὖ ἔχει, ὦς· ὅμοιον ὁμοίῳ ἀεὶ ‚testacea—Qua Ο. Salina-
tor, dec. ‘⁶ (And listened to the things) which Caius Salinator, ἀει,
were accustomed to deplore.” Observe here the anacoluthon, qum
being the relative to querelis in thought merely, not in grammatical
connection, so that it is th'e same as saying soepe interfui querelis ee
audivi quae, dcc. Compare Ep. ad· Βία, ii.,·8‚ 2: ‘⁸ Semonibus quoe
nec possunt scribi nee scribenda ’καθ’ Some of the MSS. have quae
0. Salinator, quae Sp. Albinus, of which Beier (ad Off, ii., p. 150,
865) and' Hermann both approve; but we have preferred allowing
the ordinary text to remain anchanged.
