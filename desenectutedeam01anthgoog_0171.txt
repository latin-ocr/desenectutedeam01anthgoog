CHAPTER. IX.

9 27.

Mons alter de viciis senectutis. '⁴‘ The second head concerning
the failings of age.‘’—Non plus quam. ‘⁴ Any more thaam-Tauri.
Some MSS. and early editions have vires tauri, but vires is better
understood—Quod est. “ What one has.” Equivalent to quod est
homini a namra datum—Pro viribus. ‘⁴ To the best of your ability.”
-Quoe vox. ‘⁴ What remark.”-Qnam Milonis Crotoniates. ‘¹ Than

non responsura lacertis.” The term brachium denotas the arm from
the hand to the elbum—Non vero tam isti, dcc. “In very truth,
those arms of your-s are not so dead as you yoursels are, driveler.”
With isti supply lacerti, and observo the reference in isti to the eec-
ond person, or the one addressed. The full expression would be
non tam isti lacerti sunt mortui, quam tu ipse ’nor-tuus ea, nugator.
Nihil talc. Supply in se admisit. “Allowed no such remark to
be made os him.” Literally, ‘⁴ admitted (or allowed) no such thing
against himself,” ι’. e., to his own disparagement. Translate nilei-
