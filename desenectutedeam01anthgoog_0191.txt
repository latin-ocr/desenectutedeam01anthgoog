At illa quanti sunt, dte. ⁸· But, (whatever may be said of the eon·
‘dition os old age in other respects‚) of how much value are those
other advantages for the mind3 namely, after having, as it were,
aerved out its time under the away os eoncupiscence,'’ dec. The
mind, while yielding obedience to corrupting and evil propensities,
is compared to a soldier obeying implicitly the commanda of his
leader3 and as the soldier, when hi's period os service is ended, re-
turns to his own home, so does the mind, when the warfare of the
passione has cezned, retire int0, as it were, and hold communion
with itselfi—Secumque vivere. This is well explained by H. Ste-
pbens ε “ Animus secum vinu, quum illi propemodum sevocato a socie-
tate et conragimoe corporis (De Dicin.. i., 30) vacare licet iis, quibus
gaudet, cogitationibus? (Gruter, Fa cria, voi v.,'supp1., p. 26.)
-Aliquod tanquam studii, dcc. ‘⁴ Any aliment, as it were, of study
and os learning‚” i. e., any learned studies to pursue, from which it
may derive aliment for itselfi—Otioea. ‘⁴ Tranquil,” i. e., free from
all public cares and employments. , .

Mori pene. “ Almost kill himself.” A figurative expression, to
denote the most rigid and untiring application.—G. Gallum. The
reference is to C. Sulpicius Gallus, of whom Cicero speaks, in sev-
eral passages, in terms of the highest praise. He had a more per·-
sect knowledge os Greek than any* man ot his time; he was a dis·
tinguished oraton was remarkable, also, sor his knowledge of as·
tronomy and his skill in calculating eclipses; and was altogether a
person of an elegant and refined mind. In Bc, 168 he served as
tribune os the soldiers in the army of his friend, L. AEmilius Paulus,
with whose permission he one day assembled the troops, and an-
nounced to them that on a certain night, and at a certain honr, an
, eclipse of the moon was going to take place. He exhorted them
not to be alai-med, and not to regard it as a fearsul prodigy; and
when, at the predicted moment, the eclipse occurred, the soldiers
almost worshiped the wisdom of Gallus—Patris tui. L. AEmilius
Paulus—Quoties illum lus, dcc. ⁴⁶ How osten has* the light os day
surprised him, after having begun at night to trace out some math-
ematical figure.” Literally‚ ⁸‘ to trace out (or delineate) some-
thing.” The verb describere is here employed iti-its mathematical
sense, namely‚ to trace out figures, or diagrams, in the sand or dust.
with the radius, or rod. The full form of expression would be de·
scribere radio aliquid, i. e., formas in pulvere. ΊῚιο reference, of
course, is' to ‘both mathematica} and astronomical studies.
