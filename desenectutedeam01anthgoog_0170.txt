ply videt—Adolescentia. “Youth‚” i. e.‚ the young man. The ab·
suaet for the concrete.

,Vitiarium ‘⁴ With worse taste.'‘— Tum equidem, dvc. These two
lines are iambic trimeters, like those that precede. In the second
line, the long a in ea loses one os its component short vowels by
elision‚ but the remaining short one is lengthened by the arsis.

Jucunaum potius, dcc. ⁴⁸ N ay, pleasing rather than odious !‘’ The
full construction is immo, sentire esse se jucundum, &oe-Levior.
Equivalent to tolerabilior. xA sar better reading than leniore-Qui a
juventute coluntur, dte. compare De Off, i., 34: ‘⁸ Est igitur ado-
lescentia mjoree natu vereri, exque hia deligere optimos et probatissi-
mos, quorum consilio atque auctoritate nitatur.”-—Sed videtis, ul, dcc.
“ Yon see, then, how that old age is not merely languid and inact-
ive.” The term inere here refers to an aversion sor active labor.
-Tale seilicet, dcc. “ Of such a nature, namely‚ as was the favorite
putauit os each one in earlier lise'.”

Quid, qui etiam addiscam aliquid? ‘⁴ What shall we say of those
who even learn something additional‘l” i. e.‚ increase their ntock
os knowledge in old age—Versibus. The verse here referred to is
γηράσκω δ’ αἰεὶ πολλὰ διδασκόμενος. It is cited by Plato, 'in his Ti·- “
maeus3 by Plutarch, in the Life os Solon 3 and·by the scholiast on

ogenes Laertius (i., 62), Solon reached the age of eighty years.
Luciam, however (Marah, 18), makes him to have lived one hund-
red—Qui Graecae literas, dcc. “ Who have made mysels acquaint-
ed with Grecian literature when advanced in years.” Cato, as we
have before remarked, was acquainted in early life with the lan-
guage, but not- with the literature, of Greece. He was averse to
the latter from the influence of a strong national praejudico, which
diminished, however, in force as he grew older and wiser.- Ut ea
ipsa milei nota essent, dre. This is thrown in by Cicero, in order to
account for the Greekerudition possessed by one who had been, in
his younger days, so averse to its acquirement. (compare chap. i.,
ς 3: ‘⁴ Qui ei eruditius videbitur disputare,'’ &c.)-E:remplis. “As
illustratione (of what Ι say).'’—Quod cum fecisse Socratem, dcc.
“And when I heard that Socrates had done this in the case of the
