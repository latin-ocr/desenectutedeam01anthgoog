privileges of friend-bip, in certain circumstances, superior to moral
obligations of a much higher and more sacred nature. If we com-
pare. however, with the present passage the language of the treat-
ise De Officiis, a work subsequently publisbed, we will find therein an
idea of what Cicero means by summ tui-pitacio, which may tend to
remove the difficulty alluded to. Thus we have in cbap. x„ book iii„
os the latter work, the following limita established: ‘⁶ Neque conv-a
rempublicam, mque contra jusjurandum ac fident, amici causa, vir bonus
saciet.''-E³t enim quatenus. ‘⁴ For there is a limit up to which.”
—Nec vero . . . . nec. “Neither ou the one hand, indeed ..... nor
on the other.”—Telum. In the sense os instrumentum—Quam col-
ligere. ‘⁸ To seek to secure which, however.”-Sequicur. ‘⁴ Always
accompanies.”

Quod omnihus in rebus, dcc. This whole passage, down ιο judica-
rent, is drawn from Xenophon‘s Memorabilia, ii., 4, 2, seqq—Nec
habere quasi signa quadam, dte. Some of these “ ,ἥρπαξ’ however,
are given by Isocrates (ad Damon„ p. 11, ed. Wolf.): Μηδένα φίλον
ποιοῦ, πρὶν ἂν &farciam πῶς κέχρηται τοῖς προτέροις φίλοις, κ. r. λ.--
Ec judicare difficile est, dcc. ‘⁴ And it is difficult‚ indeed, to judge of
one unless previously tried.”—Ita praecurrit amicitia judicium, ὄιο.
“In this way friendship is wont ιο outstrip judgment, and ιο take
away the means os making a trial.”

ς 63.

Sustinere. ‘⁶ To restrain.”--Impetum benevolentia. He means
the impulse of rushing into the arms of a new friend, before we have,
in some degree at least, put his moral qualifications to the test.—
Quo utamur, dcc. Observe that quo is here the conjunction; not
the relative pronoun, as Klotz makes it.—In parva pecunia. ‘⁴ In
the case of a small sum of money.”—Perspiciuntur quam sint leves.
An imitation os the Greek construction for perspicitur quam leves

. sint quidam.-Gognoscuntur. “Are found out.’'—Imperia. ‘⁴ Com-

mands of armies.”—Potestaees. ‘⁴ civil authority.”—0pes. ‘⁴ Po-
litical influence.”-Proposita sint. “ Are placed before the vieW.”
——Obscuratum iri. ‘⁴ 'I'hat this circumstance will be thrown into the
shade,” ι’. e., that the world will be too much dazzled by the splen-
dor os the objects to take notice os the unworthy sacrifice they
make to obtain them.

ᾳ 64.
Qui in movibus versuum·- ⁴⁴ Who are occupied with honors.”--
