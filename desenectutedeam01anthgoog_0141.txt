principal obJections are stated and resuted in regular succession.
Itis held that old age is wretched : 1. Because it incapacitates men
sor active business, 2. Because it rendere the body feeble3 3. Be-
cause it deprives them of the enjoyment of almost all pleasures; 4.
Because it heralde the near approach of death. The first three are
met by producing examples of many illustrious personages, in whom
old age was not attended by any os these evils; by arguing that such
privatione are not real, but imaginary, missortunes; and that, if the
relish for some pleasures is lost, other delights of a more desirable
and substantial character are substituted. The fourth objection is
encountered still more boldly by an eloquent declaration that the
chief happiness of old age, in the eyes os the philosopher, arises
from the conviction that ἰ( indicates the near approach of death,
that is, the near approach of the period when the soul shall be re-
leased from its debasing connection with the body, and enter un-
fettered upon the paths os immortality. This piece has always been
deservedly admired as one of the most gracesul moral essays be-
queathed to us by antiquity. The purity of the language, the live-
liness of the illustratione, the dignity os the sentiments, and the
tact with which the character of the strong-minded, but sels-satisfied
and garrulous old man is maintained, have excited universal ap-
plause. But, however pleasing the picture here presented to ue,
every one must perceive that it is a fancy sketeh, not the faithful
copy of a scene from nature. In fact, the whole treatise is a tissue
of special pleading, on a question which is discussed in the same
tone of extravagance, on the opposite side, by Juvenal in his tenth
satire. The logie, also, is bad ; for in several instances general prop-
ositions are attacked by a few specious‘ particular cases, which are
mere exceptione to the rule. No one can doubt the truth osthe1as-
sertions, that old age does incapacitate us for active business, that
it does render the body seeble, and that it does blunt the keenness
of our senses3 but, while it is a perfectly fair style of argument to
maintain that these are imaginary and not real ills, it is utterly ab-
surd to deny their existence because history affords a few instanees
of favored individuale who have been exempted from their influence.

Cicero appears to have been indebted for the idea, if not the plan
os this work, to Aristo os Ceos, a Stoic philosopher (o. 1) ; much,
however, has been translated almost literally from the Republic
of Plato (compare chapters 2, 3, 14), and more ,freely from the
OEconomics and Cyropoedia of Xenophon. The passage with regard
to the immortality of the soul is derived from the Timaeus, the
Phaedon, the Phaedrus. and the Menon 3 and some editors have
