The exordium is taken from the Theaetetus of Plato, and in the
eighth chapter we detect a correspondence with a passage in the

Lysis of the same writer. The Ethics of Aristotle, and the Memo- ι

rabilia os socrates, by Xenophon, afforded some suggestions3 a

phrastus’s περὶ pezium and some hints are supposed ιο have been
taken from Chrysippus’a περὶ φιλίας and περὶ τοῦ δικάζειν. (Smitlt’s

had been in like manner the friend of the elder Africanus. Scaevola
the augur married his daughter Laelia, the elder of the name—&3

Ita eram aeduam. ‘⁸ Was introduced in so special a manner.”
Under the republic‚ young men who intended ιο devote themselves
to the study os jnrisprudenoe were usually committed to the care
of some eminent lawyer, whom they attended for the purpose of de-
riving knowledge from his experience and conversation. Under
