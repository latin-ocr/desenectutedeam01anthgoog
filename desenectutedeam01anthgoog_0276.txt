cabo, atque animam &volabo hostibus.”—C'. Fabricii. Compare Dc
Seneca, vi„ 9 15.-Μ’. Curii. Compare De Seneca, vi„ 9 16.-Se·
qnebatur. This verb is to be supplied, either in the singular or plu-
ral, in all the clauses that follow, down to αἰξί- Cn. et P. Scipiones.
Compare De Seneca, xx„ 9 'rh—Carthaginiensium domum ⁸· Tne,
entrance of the Carthaginians into Italy.” The allusion is to the
efforts of the two Scipios, who commanded in Spain, in preventing
the passage of re-ensorcements sor the army of Hannibal in Italy.—
Inter horum etates interjectus Cato. Cato was quaestor to the elder
Afric-anus 3 and subsequently, when advanced in years, extolled in
the senate the distinguished ability of the younger Africanus during
the early part of the third Punic war. (Compare De Seneca, vi„

Hujus orationis ac sententia. ‘⁸ of this mode of speaking, and of
the sentiments here advocated.”— Corinthiis operibus. ‘⁴ In articles
of Corinthian workmanship.’' The reference is to statues, columns,

“quoe loco suo moveri possune.'‘—-Illud. Compare Zumpt, 9 748.—
Voluptatem esse summum bonum. The doctrine of the Cyrenaic
school, so called from its founder, Aristippus, a native of Cyrene.
The Cyrenaic doctrine would appear to have arisen from a misap-
plication of the Socratic. Socrates considered happiness (i. e., the
enjoyment of a well-ordered mind) to be the aim of all men; and
Aristippus, taking up this position, pronounced pleasure ,the chief
good, and pain the chief evil; but he wished the mind to preserve
its authority in the midst of pleasure. (Smith, Dict. Biogr„ s. v.)—

omne laudabile est,- quod autem laudabile est, omne est honestum .- bo-
num igitur quodfer, honestum est.’' And again, Plut„ Stoic. Repugn. :
