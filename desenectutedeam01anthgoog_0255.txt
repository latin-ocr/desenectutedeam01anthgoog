abilities to manaim-Quamvis licet nullas. ‘⁴ However much you
may excel,” i. α, how great soever your authority aud influence
may be.—P. Rupilium. Publius Rupilius Rufus was consul with
P. Popilius Lanae, Rc. 132, and was remarkable for the severity
he displayed toward the followers of Tiberius Gracchum after the
death of that tribune. (Veli. Patere„ ii, 7.) The common text has
Rutilium, which Ernesti improperly retains. In like manner we
must read Rupilius in Tusa, im, 17, 940, where the same editor in·
correctly gives Rutilium—Lucium. L. Rupilius Rufus. The re-
membrance os his brother’s severity, toward the partisans of the
Agrarian law, alienated the favor of the people, and caused his de-
feat. Pliny says that P. Rupilius, who was laboring under a slight
illaesa at the time, when he heard of his brother’s repulse immedi-
ately expired. (Ptin, H. N., vii„ 36. Compare Cic„ Tusa, iv„
17, 6 4⁰.) -

Omnino amicitie, dic. ‘⁴ As a universal rule, friendshipa are then
first to be judged of when both our judgments and our years are
now strengthened and matured,” i. ae., when our minda and charac-
ters have attained to a certain degree of firmness through maturet
years—Eos habere necessarios, duc. ‘⁸ Are they to be deemed to
have those aa intimate friends, whom they have loved at that season
os life, because actuated by a fondness for the same pursuits.” We
must supply judicandi tunt before eos habere necessarios, the idea of
this being suggested by judicanda sunt which precedes. Beier less
neatly supplies judicandum est, which will give rise to the inelegant
construction eos eos habere necessarios. Compare Seyffert, ad loc.—
Jure vetustatis. ‘⁴ Through the right of old acquaintance.”—Sed alio
quodam modo. Goerenz supplies here curandi. The true ellipsis,
however, is merely negligendi non sunt iu the sense os diligendi sunt.

Aliter amicitia, διο. The idea intended to be conveyed is thie,
that were our early attachments the just foundation of amity, it
would be impossible for the union ever to be permanent, since our
inclinatione and pursuits take a different turn as we advance into
riper years—Moror. “ Habits.”—Distantia. ⁸⁸ Difference.” Er-
nesti objects to distantia, and thinks that we should read here dis-
sensio. It is true, the substantive distantia occurs nowhere else in
Cicer03 still, however, it is sufficiently defended by the employment
of distare and dietam (Orat, x., 34: “ Quid enim tam dictam quam a
severitate comita 3³²) as well as by the analogy of discrepantia and
