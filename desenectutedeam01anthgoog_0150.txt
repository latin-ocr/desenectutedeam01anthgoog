G. Salinator. Gaius Livius Salinator is meant, who was consul
A.U.c. 565. (Lim, xxxviii„ ὃδὴ-87. Albim. Spurius Posthu·
mus Albinus wne consul A.U.O. 567, and died, while augur, in 573.
-Quod carerent. Observe the employment of the subjunctive, ss
indicating merely their own sentiments, not those of the speaker or
author. So, a little aster, ⁸⁴ sine quibus βιασθῆθ’-νέωτα nullam.
‘⁴ Thin: life was of no value.” Observe that nullam here is equiva-
lent tp nullius momenti or pretii. This vita nulla is directly opposed
to the “vita ,vitaliffl os Ennius (Cia, de Am„ 6).-Goli, ‘⁴ To be
courted.”

Qui mihi mm id videbantur accusare, dcc. ‘⁸ Now these men ap-
peared to me to blame nothing os the kind that ought to have been
blamed.” Observe, in the first place, that qui here, at the begin·
ning of the sentence, is equivalent to hi autem, and consult Zumpt,
ὁ 803; and, in the next place, that id is here the same as tale.
Compare the version of Nauck: ‘⁴ nichea von der Art, was anzukldgen
gave-sen wiinJ' The common mode os rendering the clause (“ ap·

pcared to me not to blame that which should have been blamed”)
makes Cato say thet the ground of their complaint was n correct
one, but was not properly put forth! (compare the remarks of
Nauck, in the Neue Jahrb„ 12 supp. vol„ p. 559.)—Quod esset accu-
mudum. The subjunctive is here employed, because id precedes
in the sense of tale. (Zumpt, 4 556.)- Usu venirent. ‘⁶ Would ocem·
as a matter of course‚” i. a„ would necessarily be experienced by.

—Quorum ego multorum, dcc. “Of many of whom I have known

the old age to be without complent, since they both did not take it

ill that theywere released from the setters of their passione, and‚”

dte. Libidinum is here, in fact, equivalent to voluptatum. Observe‚

moreover, that qui takes the subjunctive here because indicating
the reason or ground of what precedes.

In mribus est mm in atate. ‘⁶ Lies in the habits, not in the age
of the individual‚” i. e., in the man, not in the age—Moderati, et
nec difficiles, dte. ‘⁸ Of well-regulated (lesnes, and who are neither
morose nor churlish.” The term moderati here is less coerectly
rendered by some “of moderate views.” It rather answevs, on
the contrary, to Plato's κόσμιοι (Rep.‚ 560, D.)‚ or, as Wetzel ex·
plains it, ‘⁴ Qui a voluptatibus et cupiditatibus temperare sibi possunt.”
-Importunitas et inhumanitas. ‘⁶ Unsessonable and churlish behav-
ior.”
