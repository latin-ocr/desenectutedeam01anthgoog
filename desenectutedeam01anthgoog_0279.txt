PARADOXON [ΙΙ.

ᾁ 20.

AEqualia esse peccata, dte. ‘⁴ That all crimes are equal‚ and (also
all) virtuous actions,” i. a, that good and evil deeds admit os no de-
gree, that is, all crimes are equally heinous, and all virtuous actions
equally meritorious. This same Stoic paradox is handled in the De
Fan, iii„ 9, 323 1⁰, 34; 14, 45; 15, 48; iv., 2⁷, 75, dcc. Compare
Horat„ Sat„ i., 3, 75, seqq—Rerum eveum, ‘⁶ By the issue‚” i. e„
by their effecta. The reasoning of Cicero is this: When you com-
mit a fault, neither the object nor the effects of your fault are at all
to be taken into consideration, but simply the fault itself‚ and the
fact of your conduct being criminal. Hence it follows that all faults
are equal in genere, though they may differ greatly in specie—Ipsum
illud peccare. Consult Zumpt, 9 598.-Οὶιοριιο verteris. The mean-
ing is, whether you say it was done through imprudence, or through
want of sels-control--Auri navem evertat gubernator, διο. “ whether
a pilot lose a ship laden with gold or with hay, makes a consider·
able difference as regards the nature of the damage, none as regards
the pilot’s unskilfulness.’²—Lapsa est libido. ⁸⁸ Passion has gone
astray,'‘ ι’. e.. an outrage has been committed. — Dolor. ‘⁸ The
trouble consequent upon this.”-Ese tamquam transilire lineas. ‘⁸ Ie,
as it were, overleaping certain limits.” The Stoics represented
virtue as a straight line, on either side of which men fell into vice.

Quod autem non licet, &e “ What, however, is unlawful, is made
to depend merely on the following circumstance, if it be shown,
namely, to be ‘unlawfulss' i. e., it is merely sufficient to know wheth-
er a thing be unlawful; any question about the degree of unlawful·
ness is foreign to the subject—Id. Referring to the simple fact of
an action’s being unlawful. This unlawfulnejs's can not be rendered
on any occasion either greater or less; that is, for example, it is no
more allowed you to kill a mere stranger, than another his own fa-
men—Quoniam in eo est peccatum, dcc. “ Since the fault consiste
in this, in the fact os the thing's not being lawful, which fact is
always one and the same.” ‘

ο 21. -

Quod si virtutes, dcc. “Again, if virtue8,’' dte—Nec bono viro
meliorem, &e “And that a man can not be made better than a
good man,'⁵ dcc„ i. e., that there is no better man than a good man.
Compare Seneca, Ep„ 66 : ‘⁸ Nihil invenies rectius recto,” dcc. ob-
serve, moreover, that the vir bonus here meant is not the sapiens,
