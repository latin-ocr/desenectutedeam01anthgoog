was not the slighteet pretext for hostilities3 and nothing could be
more fiagrantly unjust than the determination of Crassus. It was
in express violation of treaties; sor in the year Rc. 92, Sulla had
concluded a treaty of peace with the Parthians, and the treaty had
been renewed by Pompey with their king, Phraates. The Romans
were not very scrupulons in their career of conquest, and they often
fought from motives of gain or ambition3 but their ostensible rea-
sons generally hore adme show of plausibility, and a total disregard
of form was offensive to a people who were accustomed‚ in their

intemational dealings, to obser-ve certain legal and religione tech-'

nicalities. It was not surprising, therefore, that, spart from polit·
ical consideratione, the feelings os common justice should excite a
strong repugnance to the plens of Crassus, who, having gained his
immediate object in obtaining Syria as his province, broke out into

a display of childish vanity and boastfulness, which were alien from -

his usual demeanor. C. Ateius Capito, the tribune, ordered his
officer to arrest Crassus, but was obliged to release him by the in*-
tercession of his colleagues. However, he ran on to the gate of
the city to interoept the consul, who was anxious without delay to
proceed to his destination, and resolved to set out at once, without

Ateius kindled a' fire, and with certain fumigations, and libatione.
and invocatione of strange and terrible deities, mingled the most
awsul ›curses and imprecatione against Crassus. This was done in
pursuance of an ancient Roman rite, which was never solemnized
on light grounds; for, while it was believed to be fatal to the per·
son devoted, it was also thought to bring calamity upon the persen
who devoted another. But Crassus was not deterred. He pro·
cecded on his way to Brundisium. The evil omen daunted tho
army, and seems to have occasioned an unusual attention to disas-
trous auguries and forebodings·'; for Plutarch is copious' in his aes
count of tokens os misfortune in almost every stage of the expe-
dition.

The route ot Crassus lay through Macedonia, Thrace, the Hel·
lespont, Galatia, and the northern part os Syria to Mesopotamia.
Throughout the whole campaign he exhibited so much imprudence,
and such a complete neglect of the first principles of the military
art, that prematur-e age may be thought to have impeired his sacul-
ties, though he was now but little more than sixty years old. He
was deas, and looked older than he really was. - The aged Deiota-
rus, whom he met in Galatia, rallied him on his coming lace into
the field. He was accompanied hy some able men, especially the
