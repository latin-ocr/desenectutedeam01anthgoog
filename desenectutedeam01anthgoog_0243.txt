guinary scene 3 and from the lang-uage of the text, “propter recentem
poenam T. Gracchi,” his life appears to have been spared merely
because the people were so irritated by the recent murder os Tihe-
rius Gracchus, that the putting 1ο death os another tribune might
have exasperated them beyond all enduranee.

De cm· Graec& autem tribunam, dte. “Whau however, 1 have
reason to expect from the tribuneship of Caius Gracchus (1111666161-
11 does come), 1 do not like to conjecture.'’ Laelius refers to the
11111116 tribuneship os Caius, which he takes t‘or granted will come
as soon as 116 isofthe legal agerer obtaining it(sincehewasas
,yet too young for the office), and he purposely closes his eyes on
›the vision· of evil which he thinks 116 sees in the distance. The
present conversation is supposed 10 have taken place in Bc. 12⁹,
-and Gaius Gracchus did 1101 become tribune until B.O. iza—Serpit
enim deinde ree, 616. ⁴‘ For, ever since (that last affair), a thing is
creeping on silently (among us), which, now that it has once begun
“ to exist, keeps gliding onward for fatal mischief with nore and more

preceded the tribuneship os Tiberius, the Gabinian law having been
passed ΒΩ. 139, and the Cassian in Rc, 137, while the tribuneship
of Tiberius was 111 B.C. 133. Hence the expression jam ante in the
text. The complaint of Laelius is dietate-d by an aristocmtic spirit,
since 1116 lawa establishing voting by ballot (leges tabellaria) proved,
in fact, a strong safeguard against the encroachments 01· 1116 patri-
