words‘mang aliqua re, which precede the proposition in the ordinary
text, appear to be a mere gloss.-Impietatis. ⁴⁴ Of impiety (toward
their country.)”-Ingratoe μανία injton'am, dm. ‘⁴ Did not patiently
endure the wrong inflicted by his ungrateful country, which he
ought to have so endured.” Ernesti regards the words quam serre
debuit as an interpolation3 but they appear necessary to the sen·
tence, since otherwise it might be inserted from the expression in-
gratae patria that Laelius approved of his conduct. (Seyffert, ad loc.)
Scheller’s suggestion, that quam be taken as a particle, equivalent
to ut, or quemad-modum, “as,” is unfortunate, since Themistocles
did not endure the injury at ali. (δῶκα, obs„ p. 243.)--Mortem
eibi uterque conscivit. The suicide os Themistocles is extremely
doubtful. Thucydides evidently did not believe that he put an end
to his own lise by poison3 and, indeed, as Thirlwall remarks», it is
hardly credible that sear of disappointing the Persian king should
have urged him to such an act. (Thirlwau, Hiat. Gr„ vol. ii., p.
431, 8220 ed.) So, also, various accounts were given cf the death
of Coriolanus. (Compare Βία, ἰὶ.,40·; Cic„ Brut„ ‚103 Waclwmuth,
Gesch. des Ram. Statius, p. 313.)

Talis improborum consensio. “Such an agreement of opinion on

geuda. εξ To be screened.”—Sibi concessum. ‘⁴ That it is allowed
him.” Supply essa—Quod quidem, ut res coepit ire, dte. ‘⁴ As mat-
ters have of. late begua to go, this same thing, perhaps, may at some
future time actually take place.” Quod refers to what immediately
precedes, namely, amicum· vel bellum patria inserentem, sequi. It
appears, from several oblique insinuations ecattered throughout this
performance, that although Cicero’s principat design, in drawing it
up, was te settle the ‘true measure and offices of a very important
moral connection, yet he had an indirect vieW, likewise, to the par·
ticular principles of the timeS, and the circumstances in which pub-
lic affairs stood when he composed the work. The present passage
evidently glauces at the partisans of Julius Caesar. (Melmoth, ad

loc.)
