vulgar-minded, but ease man, whose principles sat loosely but con·
veniently upon him ; who was not likely to innovate rashly, to daz·
ale by eccentric brilliancy, or to put to shame by an overstrained
rigidity of virtue. Thus·¹ it was more prudent to combine 'with
Crassus as an ally, than to incur the opposition os his party, and to
risk the constet-influence osan enormous fortune which made the
name of Crassus proverbial for wealth. Pliny (H. N„ xxxiii, 4⁷)
values his estates in the country alone at two hundred milliens
of sesterces. He might have maintained no despicable army at
his own eost. without the means os doing this, he thought that
no one deserved to be called rich. In other less stirring times he
might have lived and died without leaving in history any marked
traces os his existence ; but in the period of transition and commo-
tion which preceded the sall of the republic, such elementa of power
as he possessed could scarcely remain neglected and quiescent.

It was part of the triumviral contract--renewed -at an interview
between the parties in Luca—that Pompey and· Crassus should be
'a second time consuls together, should share the armies and prov·
inces of the ensuing year, and should exert their influen'ee to se-
cure the prolongation sor five years of Coesar’s command in Gaul.

Notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of L. Domitius Aheno· ·

barbus, backed by all the authority of Cato of Utica (who was forced,
‘on the day of election, to leave the Campus Martius, with his “
followers, after a scene os serious riot and uproar)‚ both Pompey
'and Crassus were elect'ed consuls, B.G. 55. A law -was passed, at
the rogation os the tribune C. Trebonius, by which Syria and the
two Spains, with the⁴ right of peace and war, were assigned to ths
consuls sor' five years; while the Ganls and Illyricum were handed
over to Ooe'sar sor a similar period. In the distribution os the con-
sular provinces, Crassus took Syria.

Crassus! was anxious to distinguish himself in war. Pompey, he
saw, had subjugated the pirates and Mithradates ; Caesar had con-
quered Gaul, and was marching his army victoriously to Germany

and Britain. Mortified at successes which made him feel his inse· .

riority to both, he chose rather to enter upon an undertaking sor
which he had no genius, than to continue the pursuit os wealth and
influence at home. Armed by the lex Trebonia with power to
make war, he determlned to exercise his authority by attacking the
Parthians. This was a stretch and pei-version of the laW, for the
Parthians were not 'expressly named in· the lex Trebonia3 and the
senate, who constitutionally were the proper arbiters os peace and

war, refused to sanction hostilities by their decree. Indead, there ,
