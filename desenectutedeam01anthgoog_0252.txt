Ubi enim istum invenias. The subjunctive is here the true reading,
and impIIes that it is very unlikely that such a person can be found.
On the other hand, invenies would denote that he may, perhaps, be
found—Hae. Referring to such cases as are indicated by the words

In re ineerta. The early editions have in re certa, a reading of no
value. The reference is to a state os things in which we are alto-
gether uncertain what to do, or in what way to avert a danger that
may be threatening our life or fortune. The line is supposed to be
quoted from the Dulorestes of Ennius, and to be imitated from the
Hecuba of Euripides (v. 1226, ed. Pflugk.): ἐν τοῖς κακοῖς γὰρ ἁγαθοὶ
σαφέστατα Ι φίλοι-Ηώς duo. ‘⁴ These two tests.’'—-Contemnunt.
Supply amicos, and eos aster deserunt.

CHAPTER XVIII.

ς 65, 66.

Simplicem et communem et consentientem. ‘⁸ That an individua}
who is frank, and open, and of like turn of mind with ourselves.”
simplicem is here opposed to multiplex in the succeeding sentence.
With regard to communem compare De Seme-t„ chap. xvii„ 959. As
respects consentientem, compare the language of Sallust (Cat, xx.) :
‘⁴ Nam idem velle atque nolle, ea demum firma amicitia est.”—-Multzplex
ingenium et tortuosum. ‘⁴ A wily and crooked turn of mind.'’—-Na-
turaque consentit. ⁴⁴ And does not agree in disposition.'’— Ut ne cri-
minibus, dec. “That he neither be delighted with bringing charges
against a friend,” i. e., be neither capable of taking an ill-natured
satisfaction in reprehending the frailties of his friend—Quod initio
dixi. Compare chap. V., ὁ 18.—Haec duo tenere. ‘⁴ To hold to these
two principles of action.”-—Ingenui. ‘⁸ Of a manly spirit.”—Quam
fronte occultare sententiam. “Thau to strive to hide one's real sen-
timents under a smooth brow.” Literally‚ ‘⁶ by means of the brovt’.”
—Aliquid ab amieo esse violatum. “That some rulo of amity has
been violated by a friend.’'—Tristitia autem etin omni re severitas,
dte. ⁸⁶ Gloom, however, and severity on every occasion have each,
indeed, an air of gravity thrown around it,” ι’. e., are each proper
enough for a person of grave character. Observe here what‘gram·
marians term the superfluous use of ille added to quidem, and con-
