filum. Gernhard reads quoddam eet filum at once. Other editors,

Madvig—In hortis Scipionis, dcc. Compare chap. iv., ψ 14. -—- Qua-
lis tum patronus justitia, dte. The third book of the Do Republica,
as we glean from Lactantius and St. Augustino, contained a pro·-
tracted discussion on the famous paradox of Carneades, that justice

imbecillitatem, dec. ‘⁸ On account os the weakness and wants of
⁹ man.” This is the Epicurean view os the subJect, namely, that

friendships are to be formed with reference to the utility to be de-
rived from them. Such, also, in later days, was the opinion οἳ·
Rochefoucault: “ Ce que les hommes ont nomme amine, n’est qu’une
