Non sunt in senectute vires. A new objection, which Cato himself
brings forwerd. Compare chapter vii, at the commencement, and
chapter ix„ ὁ 27.-Εε legibus et intimis. “By both the lawe and
institutione of our country.”—Muneribu. Military and senatorian
employments are here meant. By the Rornan law, no one could be

compelled to engage in military service aster fifty, nor any senator
summoned to attend in the senate-house alter sixty years of age.—
Ntm modo. For mm modo non. (Zumpt, ᾤ ⁷24, ὁ.)

At ita multi, etc. ‘⁸ But there are many old men so utterly en·
feebled,” dcc. Another objection is here advaneed, as before, by
Cato himself, and theu answered also by him—Non proprium se·
nectutis, eze. “Is not a desect peculiar to age, but one common to
health in general,” i. ι, but the ordinary effect of ill health at any
period of life.— Quam suit imbecillus, dte. This clause is incorrectly
punctuated in almost all the editione, not even excepting those os

before it. The form is qui, without any intervening comma, refers
to an individual as already well known ; whereas filins is, qui carries
with it an unseasonable and altogether unnecessary opposition to
the other son os Africanae, who was so contemptible a character.

’ The son os Africanus mentioned in the text was Ρ. Cornelius Scipi0,

who was auguria Rc. 180. C'icero speaks of him here as a man
os more extensive acquirements than his father, and describes him
elsewhere mm„ 19; De Off, i., 33) as a person of great mental
powers. His seeble constitution, however, prevented him from be-
coming at all eminent either in civil or military lise. (Compare
Nauck, Neue Jahrb.. 12 supp. vol„ p. 564.)

Alterum illud exstitisset, dte. We have given illud with Orelli
and Madvig, instead os ille, the common reading—Lumen civitatis.
Cato means that the son os Africanus would otherwise have been a
source of as much glory to the state as his father had been—Doc-
trina uborior. ⁴⁴ A richer storo of general knowledge.”—Ejueque “
