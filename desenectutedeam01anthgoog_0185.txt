-Aa volupiam: esee reserenda. ‘⁴ Should be referred to pleasuressf
i. e.. should originate in pleasure as their leading motive and aim.
There is no philosopher in antiquity who has been so violently at-
tacked, and whose ethica! doctrines have been so much mistaken
and misunderstood, as Epicurus. The cause of this singular phe·
nomenou was partly a superficial knowledge of his philosophy, ot·
which Cicero, for example, is guilty to a very great extent, and part-
ly, also, the conduct of men who called themselves Epicuream, and
who, taking admntage of thc facility with which his ethical theory
was made the handmaid of a sensual and debauched life, gave them-
selves up to the enjoyment of sensual pleasures. At Rome, and du·
ring the time of Roman ascendency in the ancient world, the phi-
losophy os Epicurus never took any firm root, and it is then and
there that, owing to the paramount influence of the Stoic philosophy,
we meet with the bitterest antagonists of Epicurus. Cato here en-
tirely mistakes the meaning os the term pleasure in its Epicurean
sense. Pleasure, with Epicurus, was not a mere momentary and
transitor>- sensation, but he conceived it as something lasting and
imperishsble, consisting in pure and noble mental enjoymeuts, that
is, in ἀταραξία and ἀπονία, or the sreedom from pain and from all
intluences which disturb the peace os our mind, and thereby our hap·
pineas, which is the result os it. The summum ὀοπιιπι, according to
him, consisted in this peace of mind; and the great problem of his
ethics, therefore, was to show how it was to be attained. This,
then, was the meaning of Epicurus when he maintained that all our
actions ought to have pleasure (peace of mad) as their leading mo-
tiveaudaim. (Smilla, Dict Biogr, ii„ p. 34.)
