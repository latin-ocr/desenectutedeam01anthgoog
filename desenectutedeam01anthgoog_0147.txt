sources in themselves‚'‘ duc. Observa that nibil opis is here the
samo as nuez vermis aa sapientia, and that the ‘allusion is to· the
well-known Stoic maxim that the wiso man contained within him-
self all the means and requisites for a happy existence. ( Ritter,
Aac. Phil„ iii„ p. &aq—Omnis atas gravis est. “Every stage of
human life is burdensome,” i. e.‚ because they depend entirely on ex-
ternal causes, which are wholly subject tothe caprice of fortune.—
Quod natum necessitas afferat. This is in accordance with the Stoic
doctrine “ vivan convenienter mtnrae.” Compare Seneca, Epist„ ⁷1,
Q 24, 25 : ‘⁴ Sapiens stae erecta sub quolibet pondere3 nulla illum res
sanorem facim· nihil illi eorum, quoe serenda sunt, displicet. Nam
quidquid cadere in hontinem potest, in se cecidisse non queritur.”

Adeptam. ‘⁶ When attained to.” A better reading than adepti.

Obrepere aiunt eam, doc. The-idea on which the image is based lies
in Pliny's “seles obrepunt avibus'' (H. N„ x., 73). Compare AEschi-
nes Socratic. (Axiam, c. 9), λαθὸν ὑπειςῆλθε τὸ γῆρας, aiid Juvenal

Adolescentia senectus, &c Those between the ages of serenteen
and forty-six were commonly called juniores, juvenes, or adolescen-
αις those between forty-six and sixty, seniores,- aad those above
sixty, senes. Hence we see that adolescentia and senectus bordei· on
each othon—Quam octogesimum. Observe that quam is here for
potius quam.--Nulla consolatione permulcere posset, διο. “ Could
scothe a foolish old age by no consolation (in its power to impart),”
i. e., could by no means in its power console a weak and frivolous
mind under the usual consequences of a prolonged existence.

Si soletis. ·“ Since you are accustomed.” Observe that si with
the indicative has here the force of quoniam, as denoting something
camin. Had any· doubt been implied, the subjunctive would have
been used.-Quoe utinam digna esset. ‘⁶ And would that it were
worthy.” Observe, again, the employment of the relative to express
the demonstrative with a conjunction. (Zumpt, ό 803.)——Nostroque
cognomine. ‘⁴ And of the surname that has been bestowed upon me.” ·
The pronoun has here an objective force. The sumasne referred
to is that of Sapiens. His ancestors for three generations had been
named M. fomitis, and it is said by Plutarch (Vic. Cat. Mnj„ i.)
