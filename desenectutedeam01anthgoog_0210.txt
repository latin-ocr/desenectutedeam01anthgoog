as some maintain, nor to a “diccunt’' as Gemhard terme it. We
have not hesitated, therefore, to adopt degeion, the reading of Bil-
lerbeck. (Compare Becker, Obs. Crit„ p. 493 Jen. Βίωνι, 1820, p.
151 ; Hddezb. Jahrb„ 1826, p. 9, 88.) The lines of Solon, to which
Cicero alludes, are as follows:

Mn& ἐμοὶ ἄκλαυστος θάνατος· μόλοι, ἀλλὰ φίλοισι
Kal-&trram θανὸν ἄλγεα καὶ στοναχάς.

Cicero gives us the following translation of them in his Tusculap

‘⁸ More mea ne careat lacrymis .· linquamus amicis
Moerorem, ut celebrent sunem cum gemitu.”

Sed haud scio, cm, διο. “ Ennius perhaps, however, (has express·
ed himself) better.” As·regards the form of expression haud scio
an, which is intended to denote uncertainty, but with an inclination
in favor of the affirmative, consult, as before, Zumpt, 9 354, 721,

Ι and with melius supply dixerit, or cecinerit. The more literal trans-
ζ lation will require, in our idiom, the negative to be supplied with an,

l neral obsequies with weeping.” Observe that faxit is the old form
ι for fecerit. (Zumpt, ο 161, note.) This same quotation is given in a
f fuller form in Tusc. Disp„ i.‚ 15.

smus moriendi. “ Pemeption of dying.’' The idea intended to
be conveyed by the whole clause is as follows: the act of dying
may, indeed, be attendcd with a sense of pain, but it is a pain, how-
ever, which can not be of long continuance‚ dcc. The true reading
here is moriendi, not morienti, as Ernesti and Wetzel maintain.-Aut
optandus. “Is either desirable,” i. e., is either something that a
good and picus man ought ιο wish fon—Sine qua meditatione. Com-

³ “ and this is uncertain, whether (we are not ιο die) on this very
day.” The expression ivwermm est an falls under the same rule as
y haud scio an. (Consult remarks on haud scio an in § 73, and Zumpt,

Νοπ L. Brutum. ‘⁴ That not Lucius Brutus alone.” Observe
that non here, and also in the clauses that follow, is equivalent to
non modo. The allusion is to L. Junius Brutus, the celebrated op-
