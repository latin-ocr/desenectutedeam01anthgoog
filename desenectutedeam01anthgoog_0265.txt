Thais did indeed return me many ψαύειν’ This line is quoted
from tho ⁸· Euuoehu02’ ef Terence (iit, 1, l j, and is uttered by Thraso,
ι braggart captain, to his parasite Gnatho, who had just oonvoyea
Pamphila as a present from Thtttso to Thais. Thraso and Gnatho
are represented as coming on the stage in the middle os a dialogue.
and henco the apparently abrupt commenoement of tho scene. The
most natural mode os snpplying the ellipsis is by ame tu. Some
less correotly regat-d agere here as an historieal infinitivo. The line
is α oomic iambis trimeter, and is scanned as follows: “

Vanitas. “flattena'' More literany, ‘⁴ emptiness,·’ i. e„ insin-
cerity.-Assentatiom. “ Adulation.’‘—Eoecors. “Weak.'' The
opposite of the old cordatus. (Compare, in explanation of the term,
cic„ Tuec. Disp.. i., 9, 18.)—Agnoscitur. The verb agnosco here
refers to the recognizing, or taking a thing to be what tt really is.
There is no need, therefore, of our reading cognoscitur with Gem-
hard.-Det manus. ‘⁴ Stretches out his hands& i. e.,¹ in token of
being worsted.-Plus vidisse videatur. “May seem to have seen
more than he actually has‚” ι’. e„ may fancy himself possessed of
more ability than he really is.-Quod ne accidat, cavendum επιόω.
“ We must take good heed, therefore, lest this happen, as it does in
the ⁸ Heiress,’ i. e.‚ as it does in the comedy of Caecilius, entitled
Epiolerus (Ἐπίκληρος), or “ the Heiress.” After ut supply id accidit,

with Gernhard and Seyffert—Hodie me ante omnes, dcc. ‘⁴ You will ‘

have tricked me this·day more than all the dotards represented in
comedim, and will have wiped me in fine style.” Observe that
versaris and emunxerit are both in the future perfect. Emunxen's

⁶ is Bentley's emendation for the common unxeris, and suits better

the character of a master addressing his slave. The lines are comio
lambio trimeters, and scanned as follows:
