both these years, was 'rorty-seven years, not tany-six, as Cicero
makes it. This agrees, moi-cover, with the account os Valerius

years. (Vir. Mar„ c. 28.)-Ad amantis inicium esec. ‘⁴ Should be

os that period of life. According to the historiari Tubero, as cited
by Aulus Gellius (x., 28), Servius Tullius, when he classitied the
Roman people‚ divided their ages into three periods: limiting boy-
hood to the age of serenteem youth, and the full prime os lise, to
form-sim and old age, from this period to the end os life. Now
just so many years (scay-six) had formed the ‘⁸ career of honors”
(eursu-5 mmor-um) in the case of Valerius Corvus. During this pe-
riod he had been six times consul (reckoning loosely, as above
stated), twice dictator, one-and-twenty times an incumbent in cu-
rule statione, and had four times enjoxed a triumph. (Ptin, H. N„

ius Atilius Calatinus„ a distinguished Roman general in the first
Punic war, who was twice consul (Bo. 258 and 254) and once
dictator (Rc. 249). He was appointed dictator sor the purpose of
carrying on the war in Sicily in the place οἰ Claudius Glycias ; but
nothing' of importance was accomplished during his dictatorship,
which is remarkable only for being the first instance in Roman his-
tory of a dictator’s commanding an army out os Italy. (Lim, Epie.,

aster, an inscription on a tomb. Gaza erroneously refers unicum to
quem, and translates εἰς ἂν ενα. The totnb of Calatinus, containing
the inscription given in the text‚' was near the Capenian Gate.
(Cic, Tmo„ i.. 7, 13.)-Plurim consentiunt gentes, dte. This in-
scription occurs, also, in the treatise De Finibus (ii, 3β); but there
it runs as follows: Uno ore cui plurima mensiune, dcc. ; for which
Orelli now reads Unum hunc plurima. dte.. and regards unicum, in
our text, as a corruption for unum himo, which last Madvig actually

exhibit unicum, we have deemed it best to make no alteration-
