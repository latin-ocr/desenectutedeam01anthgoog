and unusual reading, and it is essily susceptible os defence from
Off„ i., 25, 67, as well as from other passages cf cioepo cited by
Gemhard. The plainer and clearer form οι· expression, however,
would undoubtedly be similiterque saciant, ut, si qui, dae—Ille autem.
The pilot, or steersman, is meant. Ernesti maintains that ipse is
the true reading, not ille, because it is opposed ιο alii. But Cicero
would only have written ipse, is be hed meent the pilot to be re·

garded es exercising authority over the rest. Ille, therefore, must ἱ

not be disturbed. The csse, however, is different with regard to
autem, which appears quite superfluous, and which we have, there-
fore, included within brackets, as Orelli has done.

Aut eomitatibus, aut celeritate corporum. The term velocitas means
merely ‘⁶ swistness,” such as is seen in running; celeritas, on the
contrary, is ‘⁴ agility.’‘ (Gernkard, ad loc.) The plural, velocitatibus,
is peculiam but still we ought not to think it any stranger than sor-
tiendim, in Off, i., 22, cr tarditates and celeritates in Off„ i., 36.
