Quamquam a multis, dte. Pacciolati conjectures namque sor quam-
quam, which Manutius and Graevius even admit into the texts All
the MSS, however, give quamquam, and the whole difficulty will dis-
appear is we merely connect this latter term more closely with
what precedes, than is done in most editions, which make a new
sentence commence with quamquam, instead os placing merely a
colon aster consentiunt. As virtue forms the basis os true friendship,
one would imagine that there would also be an undivided opinion
in relation to this quality, but it wiu he found upon examination ειη(
friendship alone enjoys this distinction.— Venditoecio quadam. “ A
kind of idle parade.” Venditatio properly deuotes a setting off or
incommending of a thing intended sor sale, and then, generally,
any specious display or idle parade—Tenuis victus cultusque. ‘⁴ A
stuza! table and a plain mode of life.’‘·—·-Ut nibil maias, dcc. Be·
