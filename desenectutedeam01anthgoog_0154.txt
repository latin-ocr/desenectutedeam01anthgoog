praiee of Fabius Maximus, which occurred in the twelfth book of hie
Annals. We find them quoted again by Cicero in hig treatiee Do
Officiis, i., 71, and referred to by several other writers. Virgil hae
imitated them in part in hie AEneid (vi, um: “
“ Tu Maximus ille es,
Unus qui nobis cunctando restituis rem.'’

Livy also remarks (xxm, 26); “ Sic nihil certius est, quam unum
hominem nohis cunctando rem restituisse, sicut En nius ait.” Compare
Column. acl Eun„ Fragm„ p. 98.

cunctando. An allusion to the surname Cunctator, given to Fa-
bius on account of his cautious and wise delay in carrying on the
war against Hannibal—Restituit rem. ‘⁸ Reetored the etate.” Rem
for rempublicam. The military talente of Fabius were not, perhape,
of the highest order, but he understood beyond all his contempora-
ries the nature of tho struggle, the genius of Hannibal, and the die·
position of his own countrymen. Cicero says truly of him (Rep., i.‚
1), “ Bellum Punicum secundum enervavit,” a more appropriate eulogy
than this os Enniue, since Marcellus and Scipio restored the repub-
lic to ite military eminence‚ whereas Fabius made it capable of res-
toration. (Smilla, Dici. Biogr„ p. 993.)-Νοπ enim rumores, dcc.
“For he placed not disparaging reports before the safety of hie
country‚” i. e„ he went on steadily pursuing his plane for the eafety
of his country, and disregarded all the secret rumore and disparag·
ing reporta which were circulated concerning him, and which ae-

cribed his dilatory movements to cowardice. Observe that the prose
form of expression would be non enim rumores anteponebant saluti,—
Ergo‘ postque mag-isque, dcc. The idea is this z Ergo et post obitum
viri gloria claruit, et magis etiam hac aetate claret, quam quum viveret.

§11-

Tarentum vero'‚ dac. Tarentum was taken by treachery, ae both
Livy and Plutarch inform ue. Either, therefore, Cato is made to re-
fer here to some other account of ite capture, or else, though the
place was recovered from the Carthagiuiane in the way just men-
tioned, there was mom, neverthelees„ for the exercise os ‘⁶ vigilan-
ἥθ’ and “concilium.”--Salinatori. There ie an error here on the
part os Cicero. The Livius who commanded the citadel of Taren-
tum wae M. Livius Macatue (Lim, xxvii.. 25; Pluc„ Vit. Fab.‚ 23),
not Ο. Livius Salinator. The same error occure in the De Orat„ ii.‚
67, 273.-Μ«,·α opera. After the town had been taken by the Can-
tbaginians, he hed fied for refuge into the citadel, which he main-
tained notwithstanding all the attempta of Hannibal to dislodge him.
