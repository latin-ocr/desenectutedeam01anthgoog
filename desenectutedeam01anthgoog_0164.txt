‘run nn senorum. 14⁷

· οπο.

Senes. In Sparta the senate was called the γερουσία, or Assembly
os Eldere, and its members γέροντες. The Spartan γεροῦσὶα included
the two kings‚ who were its presidente, and consisted of thirty mern-
bers ; and the kings themselves„ as far as their votes were con-
cerned, ranked merely as ordinary senators. This will serve to
throw light on the expression amplissimum magistratum, which, as
employed in the text, comprehende the kings also—Externa.
‘⁸ Things relating to foreign lands.” Equivalent to historiam exter-

nam.

Cedo. ‘⁴ Tell us, pray.’' The singular sor the plural cedite, just
as we sometimes find age for agite, asin Cic. pro Leg. Manu„ 14:
‘⁶ Age vero ..... considerate.” The line in the text is taken from
the old poet Naevius, and is a comio iambic tetrameter acatalectic,

or octonarius, consisting of four measures, οι· eight feet. The scan-
ning is as follows:

Cede qui Ι victv-dm ΙΙ νέπιραόΙΙὶεᾶτη ΙΙ tantam dlmieistllie ta'm Ι cm 1 ΙΙ

’ Sic enim percontantur, dre. ‘⁸ For so they put the question, as we
find it in the ⁶ Ludus’ os N aevius‚” i. e.. for such is the question put
by some of the characters in the comedy of Naevius, entitled ⁸⁴ Lu-
due,’' or the School. Naevius was one of the early Roman poete,
having been born somewhere between 274 and 264 Ro, He was
contemporary, therefore, with Cato, though much the older of the
two. Naevius composed tragedies, comedies, and also an epic poem
on the First Punic War, during the latter part of which contest he
had performed military service—Proveniebant oratores novi, dcc.
“There came forth'a crop os demagogues of low birth, sools, mere
striplings.” Observe that novi is here equivalent to ignobiles. We
have placed a comma after stulti, with Madvig and Nauck, which
rendere the line a more emphatic one, and produces a species of
parallelism between stulti and adolescentuli. Lambinus, instead of
proveniebant oratore-r, gives provehebantur ad ree from a single Ms„
but the line with this change violates the mette. The verse is a
cornic trochaic tetrameter catalectic‚ in which novi is to be pro·
nounced as‘ a monosyllable, as in Plautus, Mil„ iii„ 1, 30:

Ρτῡυεηῑιεῠᾱηι ιι erexere· ῃ πὐῑ smmi ᾱαὸιεεειιεηιᾶιιῑ.
