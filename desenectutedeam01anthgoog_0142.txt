CHAPTER 1.'

0 Tite, oi quid ego adjuro, dcc. ‘⁴ O Titus, isin amhn shall have
aided (thee), or shall have lightened the care.” These hexameter-s
are quoted from the oid poet Ennius, who addresses them to Titus
Quinctius Flamininus, the celebrated Roman commender. But
whether hc addressed them in his own person or not, and of what
nature was the distress which is sought to he aUeviated, remains a
mere matter of opinion. Most commentatore suppose that Ennius
utters these verses hiniself, and that the distress alluded to was oc-
casioned hy the infamous conduct-of the brother of Flamininus, who
was expelled in consequence from the senate by Cato, at that time
censor, Rc. 184(1a·v., xxxix„ 42). Drakenborch, however, thinks
thatin the poem of Ennius, from which the lines were taken, they
were uttered by Sextus AElius Paetus, the colleague of Flamininus
in the consulship, and that the trouble and disquiet of the latter

· arose from the alarming prodigies which prevented for a period his

departure from Rome for the Macedonian war. ( Compare Ia'v..
xxxii.. 9.) Drakenborch's opinion appears the more correct one.
Cicero, on 'the present occasion, applies these same lines to his
friend Atticus, who had the same praenomen (Titus) as Flamininus,
and whose distress arose from the gloomy s'tate of public affairs,
as connected with the usurpation of cesar.

Adjuro. Some editions have adjecero, hut adjuro, as Drakenborch
remarks, is the more correct form, being hy syncope sor adjuvero,
fiko morunt and admorunt for moverunt and admoverunt. (Sil. Ital„
xit, 141; Virga, En„ iv„ 367.)—Levauo. · Old form for levavere,

thee in a severish state of mind, or, more literally, causes thy bosom

Versat. ‘⁸ Keeps continually harassing.” Observe the force of the
