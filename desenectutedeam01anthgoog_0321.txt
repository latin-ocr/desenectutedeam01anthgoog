Scipio loquitur. The form selected by Cicero sor the De Republica

(os which, as just remarked, the Somnium Scipionis formed a part)
was that ordialogue, in imitation of Plato, whom he kept constantly

in view. The epoch at which the several conferences, extending ‚

over a space of three days, were supposed to have been held, was
the Latina serio, or Latin holidays, in the consulship of C. Sem-
pronius Tuditanus and Μ’. Aquilius, Bc. 129. The dramatis per·
sonoe consisted of the younger Africanae, in whose suburban gar-
dens the scene 'n laid, and to whom the principa! part is assigned ς
his bosom friend, C. Loelius the Wise; L. Furius Philus, consul
ΒΩ. 186, celebrated in the annale of the Numantiae war, and bea'r-
ing the reputation of an eloquent and cultivated speaker (Brut, 28 ) 3
Μ’. Manilius, consul Bc. 149, under whom Scipio served as military

tribune at the outbreak of the third Punic war, probably the same ‘

person as Manilius the famous jurisconsult3 Sp. Mummius, the
brother os him who sacked Corinth, a man of moderate acquire·
ments, addi'cted to the discipline os the Porch; Q. AElius Tubero,
son os AEmilia, sister of Africanus, a prominent opponent of 'the
⁰ Gracchi, well skilled in law and logic, bnt no oraton P. Rutilius
Rufus, consul B.c. 105, the most worthy citizen, according to Vel-
leius, not merely of his own day, but of all time, who, having been
condemned in a criminal trial (B.c.,92), although innocent, by· a
conspiracy among the¹ equites, retired to smyrna, where he passed
the remainder os his lise in honorabis exile, Q. Mucius Scaevola,
the augur, consul Rc. 117, the‘first preceptor of Cicero in ‚iuris-
prudence3 and, lastly, C. Fannius, the historiari, who was absent,
however, on the second ‹la‘y of the conference, as we learn from
the remarks of his father-in-law Laeliua, and of Scaevola, in the De
Amicitia, ἧι, 7. (smmi, Dice. Βέρρῃ, vol. 12, p. ⁷28.)
