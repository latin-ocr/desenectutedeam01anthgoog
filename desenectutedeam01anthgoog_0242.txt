Εο loco. ‘⁴ In that situatinu.” The reference is to the present
complexion of the times, which made it peculiarly necessary to
guard against introducing principles that might asterward be pro-
ductiva of fatal disturbances in the stater—Dqfleaeie jam aliquantu-
lum, dec. ‘⁶ Already, indeed, has the discipline of our forefathers
swerved somewhat from its accustomed course and line of direc-
tion. ’⁹ A metaphor borrowed from the games of the circus. Spa.-
tium is the course to be traversed; curriculum the line os direction
observed in traversing that course. Laelius means that they have

who headed, as above mentioned, the senatorial party that slew
Tiberius Gracchus. The people were so exasperated at him for his
conduct on this occasion that they insulted him as often as he ap·

advisable to send him on an embassy to Asia, although, as pontifex
maximus, he could not properly quit Italy. In this kind of banish- ’
ment he wandered, for some time, from place to place, a melan-
choly ,and dispirited exile, till at length grief put an end to his life
in an obscure town belonging to the territory os Pergamus. (Plan,
