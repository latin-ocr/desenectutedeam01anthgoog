Plautus! dte. Plautus, the celebrated Roman comio poet, was a
native of Sarsina, in Umbria. He died in the year in which Cato
was censor, namely, Rc. 184. The two comedies here mentioned,
the Truculentue, or ⁸⁸ Clown‚” and the Pseudolus, or ‘⁶ Cheat,” were
two os his savorite pieces. They have both come down to us along ’
with eighteen others—Divitem. Livius Andronicus, with whom
Roman literature properly begins, was a dramatio poet, who fleur-
ished about Re. vlu—Cum fabulam docuisset, ‘⁶ Aster having ex·
hibited his first play.” More literally‚·“aster having taught a play
(to the actors).” The expression docere fabulam is the same as tho
Greek διδάσκειν δρᾶμα, and refers to the custom, on the part of the
scenio poets, of teaching the actors their parts, and superintending
the whole getting up and bringing out os their pieces. Whether
the play os Andronicus here alluded to was a tragedy or comedy is
uncertain—Centone Tuditanoque. Ο. Claudius Cento (son of Ap-
pius Claudius Caecus) and M. Sempronius Tuditanus, B.C. 240.

P. In‘cim'i Crassi. Already mentioned in ό 2⁹7.—Hujue P. Scipio· ’
nis. ⁴⁶ Of the present Publius Scipio.” The allusion is to P. Scipio
Nasica, who was consul in B.C. 162, along with C. Marcius Figu-
lus; and who, in the year in which this discourse is supposed to
have been delivered, was Pontifex Maximus, and already advanced
in years.--M. Cethegum. Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, who was
censor Rc. 209, with P. Sempronius Tuditanus, and consul in Ro.
204, with the same colleague. His eloquence was ratsd very high,
and hence the epithet os Suada medulla, applied to him by Ennius.
(Compare Brut„ 15.) Horace twice refers to him as an ancient
authority sor the usage of Latin words. (Εμ, ii., 2, 1163 Ep. ad·

choicest gifts. (Compare Aul. GelL, xii„ 2; xviii.. 4; and Cic„
