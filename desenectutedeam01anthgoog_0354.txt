passage has given rise to much discussion, and some propone dicis

planation of Van staveren, however, appears most satisfactory, and
is as follows: The consuls meant were Dolabella and Marc Antony,
and the provinces referred to were, in the case os Brutus, Crete;
and in that of Cassius, cyrene. These provinces Dolabella and
Antony had been prevailed upon by the senate to give to Brutus and
