illc fulgor. Jupiter was regarded as a planet of salutm-y influence,
because Jove was viewed ss the author os light, and hence termed
Diespiter. (Compare Macrobius, Sat„ i., 15; Id. ad Sanun. Scip„ i.,
19.)

The idea is, that the sun mles almost in the centre of this region.

Hic est, inquit ille, qui immanis, &a ‘⁶ This, replied he, is that
harmony which, formed from a combination os unequal intervalla, but
yet, st the same time, strictly calculated according to just propor-
tione, is produced ,by the impulse and movement of the spheres
themselves, and which, blending sharp tunes with grave, calls forth
varied accords in regular order.” We have here the famous Pytha-„-
goi-ean doctrine of the music of the spheres. Pythagoras conceived
that the celestial spheres, in which the planete move, striking upon
the ether, through which they pass, must produces sound, and that
this sound rnust vary according to the diversity of their magnitudes,
velocity, and relative distance. Taking it for granted that every
