Hence he claimed the merit of recovering the town, because its
citadel had never fallen into the hands of the enemy.

In toga. “In civil life,” i. e., as a statesman.--Comul iterum.
This was in B.C. 228. But the tribuneship of Flaminius and his
agrarian law were four years later, according t· Polybius (ii., 21 )‚
so that Cicero appears to have made an error here also. Indead,
his statement bears improbability on the very face of it 3 for we know
that in B.C. 227 C. Flaminius was praetor5 and the aristocratic party,
which he had irreconcilably offended by his agrarian law, would
surely never have suffered him to be elected praetor the very year
aster his tribuneship. '(Smitli’e Dict. Biogr., vol. ii.. p. 166.)—Agrum

· Picentem et Gallicum viritim dividenti. “ Proposing to divide the

Picene and Gallic territory (among all the plebeians) man by man.”
Observa the force of the present participle dividenti, which becomes
equivalent here to divisuro, or dividi jubenti. The territory referred
to lay partly in Picenum and partly among the Galli Senones on the
coast of Umbria. The MSS. vary between Picentem and Picenum.
Both Picens and Picenus are in use ; but on the present occasion the
former is to be preferred, since, in addition to MS. authority, it has
the express testimony os the grammarian Charisius in its favor
(In-etit. Gramm„ ii, p. 198, ed. Putech).

Augurque cum esset. “And although he was an augur.” Ob-
serve the force of cum. Although a member os the augural college,
he was nevertheless so free from superstition, and of so liberal a
spirit, as to declare, dcc. (Fae-civiaci, ad loc.) The idea is bon-owed
from Homer (IL, xii.. 243), εἷς οἰωνὸς ἄριστος, ἀμύνεσθαι περὶ πάτρης.
-Quae contra rempublicam ferrentur. ‘⁶ That those things which

were aimed against the state.” For ferrentur ..... ferri ,- another,
but very inferior, reading is fierent . . . fieri.
§ 12.

Filii. Fabius had two sons, the younger of whom survived him.
(Lim, xxxiii, 42.) The elder son, who is the one here meant, was
named Quintus Fabius Maximus, aster his father, and was consul
A.U.C. 541 (3.0. 213), along with Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus,
immediately aster the fourth consulship of his father—Est in man-

· ihus laudatio. ‘⁶ The funeral oration (pronounced by him) is in every

body’s hands.'' According to Cicero (Brut, 14, 18), Fabius, though,
strictly speaking, not eloquent, was yet neither an unready nor an
illiterata speaker.-—Non contemnimus? ‘⁴ Do we not contemn in com-
