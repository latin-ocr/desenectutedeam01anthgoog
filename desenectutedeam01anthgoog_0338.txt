votes of two tribes. (Cia, Phil.. xi„ 8.) ,But, notwithstanding
this slight, he still possessed great influence3 for when the tribune
Papirius Gerbo proposed ο law, that the people should be at liberty
ιο re-elect their tribunes as osten as they pleased, the eloquent
speech of Scipio induced the people ιο reject the measure, though
it was in their own favor. (Cia, De Am„ 25.) Soon aster this,
however, a circumstance occurred which called forth the bitterest
opposition of the popular party against him. Scipio had made a
proposition in favor of the old Italian veterane, which had been ap-
proved os by the senate, and according to which, the disputes arising
out of the distribution of the public land should not be decided bf
the distributore, but by other persons. This measure produced a
delay in the distribution itself, and the popular leaders, 1³¹. Flaccus,
C. Gracchus, and Papirius Carbo, made the bitterest invectives
against Scipio in the assembly, and called him the enemy of the
people. When Scipio repeated his approvsl of the death os Grac-
chus, the demagogues cried out, ‘⁸ Down with the tyrant !”

Aster these fierce debates Scipio went quietly home, accompanied
by the senate and a great number of Latins and other allies, In
the evening he went into his bed-roem with the intention of writing
a speech ιο be delivered the following morning. But in the mom-
ing Scipio was found dead in his bed (120, B.C.). An investigation
into the cause of his death was prevented by the multitude, alid the
event remained s secret. Public opinion pointed out many· who
were suspected of having murdered him ; as, for instance, Cornelia
the mother of the Gracchi, his own wife Sempronia, and Papirius
carbo, but the beaviest suspicion fell upon the last-mentioned in-
dividual. (Compare Gerlach, Der Tod des P. Cornelius Scipio AEmil-
