ron (ὸξῦμορον). We have given the reading suggested by Lambi-
nus, which harmonius with the Greek version of Gaza. Gruter
and others read via, i. e., siaa, in the ablative. The common text
of the fragments of Ennius has dementi ecee flexere ruina, which
Gruter very properly condemns. Some editors, and among them
Ernesti, give dementes me flexere 3 omitting viai, Others, again,
bave &meniu ecee fluere viem, the conjecture os Scaliger, vietae
having the force of languida, or vir-ibus privata—Vidi. Observa
the long penult, and consult Anthon's‘Lcm'n Prosody, p. 19.

Et tamen ipsine Appii, doc. ‘⁶ And yet the speech os Appius him-
self is still extant, ” i. a, although the speech itsels of Appius is still
extant The meaning is this: Even, however, if you were not ac-
quaintetl with the poem of Ennius, yet the extant speech itself would
put you in full possession os all the circumstances of the case.
Plutarch (Vir. Pyrrh„ 19) gives us the substance of this celebrated
oration—Hac ille egit. Not hanc, as the common text has it, since
agere orationem, notwithstanding the defence of it made by Scheller,
is not good latinia-*Septem et decem anm, dec. The time meant
is A.U.C. 4⁷4, Rc. 280, the second consulship of Appius having
been in A.U.C. 458, B.C. 296. The seventeen years are made up
by including in the computation‚ according to the Roman custom,
both⁶ the years 280 and 296, or 474 and 458.—Intersuisunt. Better
ἱ than inter-fluxium, the reading of some editions, which is not Cice-
πώεα-»Δηὼ superiorem comulatam. His first consulship is meant.
He was elected censorin Rc. 312, with G. Plautius, without hav-
ing been consul previously, and he held the censorship until B.C.
³0⁷, when, aster resigning this office, he was chosen consul for the
first time—Grandem. supply atate, or annis. Supposing that he
obtained the consulship at the legal age (43 years), he would be at
the period referred to in the text nearly. 70 years old—Et tamen
sic a patribus accepimus. The idea intended to be conveyed by this
is well expressed by Otto: ‘⁴ Ee, quamquam plane grandis natu erat
Appius, tamen haec eum hac oetate fecisse accepimus a.patribus.”

Nihil igitur afferunt. ‘⁶ 'I'hose persons, therefore ,bring sorward a
mere nullity. ” Compare Billerbeck,‘ ‘Diejem'gen bringeri also eo gut
wie Nichts vor! A much inferior reading is nihil armat, which
has been deservedly reJ'ected by Lambinus and others. ——Simt’lesque
sunt, ut, si qui. This reading has been objected to by some editors,
and Lambinus cites in place of it, from one of his MSS„ similesque
sum iis, qui, which Gravius receives into the text. It is, neverthe-
