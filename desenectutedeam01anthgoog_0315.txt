the acomint of Plutarch. crassas lost hisson in the battle, and
endeavored to eneourage the soldiers under a eulamity which, he
said, concerned him alone. He talked to them of honor and their
eountry; but the saint and languid shout with which they responded
to his harengue, attested their dejectiori. When night came on the
Parthians retired, it being contrary to their enstom to pass the
'night near an enemy, because they never fortified their campa, and
because their horses and arrows eould be of little use in the dark.
In this miserante state of affairs, Octavius and Cassius found Cras-
sus lying upon the ground, as if he were snmned and senseless.
They held a eouncil of war, and determined ιο retreat at once, leav-
ing the wouuded ou the field. Orassm, with such of the troops a·
had strength to march, retired to Charra (the Haran of scripture), ἡ
and, on the following morning, the Parthians entered the Roman
oamp, and massaored the sich and wounded ιο the'number of four
thousand. They then wrsued and overtook four eohorts, which
had lost their way in the dark, and put all but, twenty ιο the

Surenas, having aseertained that crassus and the principaii offi-
eers of the Roman army were shut up in Chai-ne, and fearing that
they might altogether escape, again had reoourse ιο stratagema and
treachery. Crassus was induo'ed to take a guido, Andromachae,
who acted as a miter, and led the army into danger-oua demes.
Having eseaped from this snare, he was forced, by the mutinous

threats of his troops, though his eyes were open ιο the inevitable ,

result, to aeeept a perfidious invitation from Surenas, who offered a
pacifie interview, and held out hopes that the Romans would be
allowed to retire without molestation. At the interview, a horse,
with rich trappings, was led out as a present from the king to ctas.-
sus, who was fomibly placed upon the saddle. Octavius, seeing
plainly that it was the objeet of the Parthians to take Crassus elige,
seized the horse by the bridle. A seuffie ensued, and Crassus fell
by some unknown hand. Whether he was dispmhed by an enemy,
or by some friend who desired ιο save him from the ἀὴρ-ωε of be·
coming a prisoner, is uncertain. In the course οῦ this expedition-
one of the most dina-trem in which the Romans were ever engaged
against a foreign enemy—Crassus is said ιο have lost twenty thou·
