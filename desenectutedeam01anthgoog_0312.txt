quoestm C. Cassius Longinus (aster-ward one of Caesar's murder-ers)
and the legate Octavius; but he did.not profit by their advice. He
was quite uninformed as ιο the character and resources of the ene·
my he was going to attack; sancied that he should have an easy
conquest over unwan-like people; that countless treasnres lay beron

him, and that it would be a matter of no difficulty ιο outstrip tho -

glor-y of his predecessore, Scipio, Lucullus, Pompey, and push on
his army to Bactria and India. ' He did not attempt to take advant-
age of the intestine dissensione in Parthia ,- did not form any cord·-
ial union with the Armeniam and other tribes who were hostile to
the Parthians, and did not obtain correct information as to the posi·
tion of the enemy's force and the nature of the country. On the
contrary, he listened ιο fiatterers3 he suffered himself to be grossly

- deceived and misled‚ and he alienated, by ill-treatment and ‘inso-

Ιοιιοο, those who might have been useful and were disposed ιο be
friendly. After crossing the Euphrates, and taking Zenodotium, in
Mesopotamia (a success on which he prided himself as ir it were a
great amicit), he did not follow up the attack upon Parthia, but
gave time ιο the enemy to assemble his forces, and concert his pians
and choose his ground. I-Ie was advised by Cassius to keep the
banks of the Euphrates, to make himself master of Seleucia (which
was situate on a canai connecting the Euphrates and the Tigris),
and to take Babylon, since both these cities were always at enmity
with the Parthians. He chose, however, aster leaving seven thou:-
sand infantry and one thousand cavalry in gai-rison in Mesopotamia,-
to recross the Euphrates with the rest of his forces, and to pass the
winter in Northern Syria. In Syria he behaved more like a rev·
enue officer than a general. He omitted ιο muster and exercite
the troops, or ιο review the armor and military stores. It is true
ffiat he ordered the neighboring tribes and ehiestains ιο furnish re-
cruits and bring supplies, but these requisitione he willingly com·
muted for money.= Nor was his cupidity satisfied by such gains.
At Hierapolis there was a wealthy temple, dedicated to the Syrian
goddess, Derceto or Atargatis (the Ashtaroth os scripture), who pre-
sided over the elementa of nature and the productiva seeds of
things. (Pam, H. N„ v., 193 Str-ah.¹ xvi„ in fin.) This temple he
¹ plundered of its treasures, which it took several days to examine
and weigh. One of the ill omens mentioned by Plutarch occurred
here. Crassus bad a son, Publius, who had lately arrived from
⁸ Italy, with one thousand Gallie cavalry, to jein his father’s army.
The son, dn going' ont of the temple, stumbled on the threshold‚ and

the father, who was following, fell over him. Josephus (Ana, xiv„ -
