Quam illam excisam csse cognovero. Cato did not live to see the ful-
fillment osswhat he so eagerly desii-ed, but died three years before
the overthrow of Carthage, B.c. 149. (Veli. Pac„ i., 13, 1.)

Quam palmam, dcc. Compare with this the account given in
Liv., Epic„ 49, that when Cato heard of the exploit of the younger

Scipio, who was then serving as a tribune of the soldiers, in having· .
saved the Roman army by his prudence and resolution, he declared Ι

in the Roman senate, ‘⁸ reliquos, qui in Africa militarent, umbras mil-
itare, Scipionem vigere.'’— Ue avi reliquias persequare. “ That you
may follow out what was lest unfipished by your grandsire,” ι’. 6.,

, may complete the work which he so happily began, and lay Car-

thage in the dust. The younger Scipio, as before remarked, was a
son of L. AEmilius Paulus, but was adopted into the Scipio family
by the son of the elder Africanus} the latter, therefore, is here styled
his gramana—Tertius hic et tricesimus, διο. Many editors read
quintus here ; but we have retained the common lection, with Madvig
and Orelli. 'I'he change would probably be a correct one, could we
be certain with regard to the system of chronological computation
which Cicero has followed—Sed memoriam illius viri, dcc. It sounds
strangely to hear Cato always speaking in terms of high eulogy of
the elder Africanus, against whom, according to Plutarch and other
writers, he cherished feelings osso unfriendly a nature. '

Novem annis. - Here, again, a correction is made of decem for no-
vem, by those editors who have written above quintus for tertius.
The same remark will apply to this emendation as above given.
—Excursiona “Running forth.” A military exercise is meant,
which was especially used in the training of light troops, and con-
sisted in sallying forth as if to meet a foe. Compare Cia, de Dicin„
ll, 10: “ Sed haec suerit nobis, tamquam levis armatum, prima orati-

onis excursio ,·'’ which passage will also afford a sufficient answer to
Gruter's proposed reading of decursione—Saltu. ‘⁶ Leaping.'’ Put

here for the actus agendi. Another military exercise is meant, which
was performed most commonly in armor, in order to train the soldier
for leaping trencheS, springing upon the foe, &c.——Quae nisi essent.
⁴⁴ For had not these qualities existed.'’ (Zumpt, ο 803.)—Senatum.
A senate in the early times was always regarded as an assembly

of alden, which is, in fact, the meaning of the Roman senatus, as of
the Spartan γερουσία. “
