pear from thia to have admitted a double praenomen, which was an
unusual circumstance. Censuit Fischer's note on the present pas·
tage—Cinnano ωπιιιίεκ. “ By Cinna’e tumult.’' The term tumult-
us ia meant to be a very emphatic one here, and refers to the fright-
l'ul eccum of alaughter that enaued at Rotae, when Cinna and Ma-
riua entered it with their armed followera. (Eua-op„ v.‚ 7.)

Atticus and the younger Mariua had been, ae already remathad, old

here: “ Ita panim de moribus, qui placent, gratiam coneiliam.” Des-
ouret ia altogether wrong in rendering it by the French term credie.
-Versuram facere publice. ‘⁴ To change a public creditor,’' i. e., to
hori-ow money of one in order to pay another some deht due by the
atate. The term versum means, properly, a turning or changing,
and hence >amaram facere ia to change a creditor, or to bon-ow of
one to pay another. Compare Donatus, ad Tarum„ Pharna, v„ 2,

what was meant to be a friendly loan. And yet, on the other hand,
Atticus neglected no meane of making money. We read, for in-
