with sn ermed body os slaves end gladiators3 Fabricius had also
brought srmed men to support him, and‘a bloody light ensued, in
which the party os Fabricius was worsted. Soon nster-ward, Clo-
dius with his men fell upon another os his opponents, the tribune
Sextius, who nearly lost his lise in the fray. He attacked the house
os Milo, another of the tribunes, and threatened his life whenever

purpose of destroying the censorini records; inter-rupted the Apol-
