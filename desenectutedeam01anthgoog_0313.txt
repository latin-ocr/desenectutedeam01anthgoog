⁷3 ‘ML sua.. i.. &gives a circumstantia} account of the plunder-
οῖ the Temple at Jerusalem by Crassus ς but the narrative is not free
from suspicion, sor Jerusalem lay entirely out of the route of Cras·
sus, and was at a distance os between four hundred and five hund-
red Roman miles from the winter-quartem os the army ; and we
believe that no historiari but Josephus mentions the occurrence, if
ve except the author os the Latin work ⁴⁶ De Bello Judaico” (i.‚ 21),
which is little more than an enlarged translation os josephus, and
pasees under the name of Hegesippus. To the· Divine judgment
for his sacrilege on thia ooo-sion, Dr. Prideaux (Ommatium, part 2)
attributos the subsequent infatuation of Crassus. According to this
account, Eleazar, treasurer of the Temple, had, for security, put a
bar or gold: <is tho weight of three hundred Hehrew minae, into a 1101-
lowed beam, and to this beam was attached the veil which separa-
ted the Holy Plaee from the Holy of Holies. Perceiving that Cras·
sus intended to plunder the Temple, Eleazar endeavored to com-
pound with him, by giving him the bar of gold ou condition that he
would spate the other treasures. This Crassus promised with an
cath, · but had no sooner received the gold, than he 'seized not only
two thousand taleuts in money, which Pompey had lest untouched,
but every thing else that he thought worth carrying away, to the
valna os eight thousand talenta more.

Orodes (Arsaces XIV. )‚ the king os Parthia, was himself engaged,
with part of his army, in an invasion of Armenia3 ’out he dispatchss
ed Surenas, the most illustr-icus of his nobles, and a young, accom-
plished general, into Mesopotamia with the rest os his forces, to hold
Crassus in check. Before proceeding te hostilitieS, he sent ani-²
baaaadors to Crassus, to say that, if the Roman general made war
by the authority of the senate, the war could only terminate by the
destruction of one or other os the parties; but if at the prompting
of his own desire, the king would take compassion on his old age,
and allow him to withdraw his troops in safety. Crassus replied
that he would give his answer at Seleucia. “”Sooner, said the
' ambassador, Vagises, “ shall hair grow on the palm of this hand
. than thy eyes behold Seleucia.” Artavasdes, the king of Armenia,
sequester Crassus to join him in Armenia, in order that they might
oppose Orodes wit-h their united forces ; he pointed out to the Ro-
man general that, Armenia bbing a mountainous country, the cav-
alry, of which the Parthian army was almost entirely composed,
would there be useless3 and he promised to take care that in Ar·
menia the Roman army should be supplied with all necessaries.
In Mesopotamia, on the other hand, the Romans would be exposed
