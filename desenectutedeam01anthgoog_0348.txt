Auxit hoc ‹fio-ium, dcc. ‘⁴ He added to this obliging conduct by
another act of liberality also-”—Sex modii tritici. The modius was
the principal dry measure of the Romans, and contained one gallon,
7-8576 pints English. The common text has septem, which can not

be correct, and must have arisen from an error of the copyists (VII. ‘

for VI.). It is well ascertained that the Attic medimnus was equal
to six (not seven) Roman modii. (Consult Wurm, do pond„ num,

Communis mfimis, dno. ‘⁶ Affable to the lowest, equal to the high·-
est,” i. a, equaI, in point of merit and public esteem, to the first
men of the state. As regards the force of communie here, com-
pare the explanation of Tzschucke: ‘⁴ Qui se non superbe supra
alios extollit, inferiores maxime, sed se ad eos demittis, communis voca-
tur-3⁹ — civemque facere studerent. This was regarded as a high
honor, and was only confer-red 'upon those who had deserved well
of the state. (Compare Mem-sius, Fortun. Act„ c. 5.)-an beneficio
ille uti noluit. Cicero, however, calls him a citizen oi· Attica (Ep.
ad Ata, i.‚ 16; xi, 1); but this refers, as would appear, merely to
his cognomen, not to any actual citizenship—Amica· civitatem Ro-
manam, dcc. ¹⁴ That Roman citizenship was lost in case any other
was assumed‚'' i. e., acquired. This was in strict accordance with
the Roman law. Under the emperors‚.however, a ,milder rule pre-
vailed, and a Roman citizen was allowed to acquire the rights os
citizenship in another state. (consult Salmas„ obem. ad Jue Att.

Ipsi et Phidia. The Phidias here meant must not, of course, be
confounded with the celebrated sculptor and statuary, who flourished
long before. The reference is to some individual of the same name,
whose faithful public services procur-ed for him the honor mentioned
in the text3 but of whom no account is given by any other writer.
Some editors, therefore, regarding this Phidias as a personage al.
together unknown, read Pilioe for Phidia, and make Nepos refer to
Pilia, the wife of Atticus, whom Cicero osten names in his letters
