one should not be able, in consequence of age, to har-angue in the
forum or senate, still he may at his own abode impert the lessons
of eloquence and wisdom to young men of promise 3 your-sels, for in·
stanes, Scipio, or our friend Ltelius here—Studiis juventutis. ‘⁸ By
a crowd of the young eager for instruction.” Equivalent to grege
juvenum studiosorum.

An ne relinquemus. ‘⁴ Shall we not leave.”—Ad omne officii munus
instruat. ‘⁴ To train them up to every discharge os duty, ” i. e., to
the proper discharge of every duty. The Greek version has' αγειν
εἰς ἅπαν καθῆκον. -Οπ, ct P. Scipiaemes. “Cneius and Publius Scip-
io. '’ These two individuale were brothers, and distinguished them-
selves by a series of brilliant victories in Spain over the Carthagin-
ians. They both fell in battle, Bc. 211. Cneius was the father.
ot· Scipio Nasica Optimus, and Publius os the elder Africanus—L.
AEmilius et P. Africanus. The L. AEmilius Paulus here meant is
the one that lost his life at Cannas. His son, L. AEmilius Paulus
Macedonicus, the conqueror 01 Macedonia, was the father ofAEmil-
ianus, or Scipio Africanus the younger. L. AEmilius was, therefore,
the-natural grandfather of the younger Africanus, and the elder
Africanus his grandfather by the course of adoption. Hence the
expression in the text, avi tui dua—Comitum. ‘⁸ By a suite.” It
was a favorite old Roman custom‚ for the younger Romans, in the
days os the republic, to attend upon and form the retinue of distin-
guished men, and thus practically acquire the rudiments of states-
manship and wat—Nec ulli bon'arum artium, dre. As some might
object that all old men can not be distinguished for past exploits,
and can not, therefore, be courted and followed by the young, Cicero
here proceeds to answer this objection by a general remark—Tra«,

ait. ‘⁶ Hands over.” An apt expression, and well depicting one
age succeeding to another.

psedia, viii„ 7, 8.-Οιιπι admodum senet essee. Xenophon makes
Cyrus the Elder to have died quietly in his bed, at an advanced
age (according to the common account, seventy years old), atter a
tage and Socratic discourse to his children and friends. According
to Herodotus, however, he fell ιιι battle against Tomyris, queen of
the Massagetae; while Ctesias makes him to have met with his
death from a wound received in battle with a nation called the Der·

hines—L. Metellum. L Goecilius Metellus, grandfather of Metellus
